Round 0:
all scripts A: 
A: "I want to make this a safe space for you, so feel free to share whatever feels comfortable right now. We can go at your pace, no pressure at all. What's been on your mind lately?"

all scripts B: 
B: "Thanks, I appreciate that. Not much has been on my mind, really. Just the usual work stuff and keeping busy. You know how it is."

Round 1:
all scripts of A: 
A: "I totally understand, it sounds like you have a lot going on with work. Sometimes staying busy can be both a distraction and a way to cope. Is there anything about your work or daily routine that's been particularly challenging or rewarding lately?"

all scripts of B: 
A: "That's understandable, work can definitely be consuming. Sometimes when we're busy, it's easy to push aside other thoughts or feelings we might have. When you're not working, how do you like to spend your time?"  

B: "I just try to relax, catch up on some shows, maybe read a bit. Nothing too exciting, really."

Round 2:
all scripts of A: 
A: "It sounds like you find a little escape in your shows and books. I'm curious, do any of them resonate with you on a particular level or remind you of something in your life?"

all scripts of B: 
B: "Yeah, I try not to think too much about everything else when I’m off. It’s just easier to unwind that way, you know? Plus, with so much going on at work, I figure I deserve the downtime."

Round 3:
all scripts of A: 
A: "Absolutely, downtime is important, especially when work feels so demanding. When you’re watching or reading, do any of the characters or stories ever remind you of aspects of your own life, or maybe evoke certain feelings?"

all scripts of B: 
A: "Absolutely, taking that downtime is really important. It makes sense to have those moments where you can just switch off. Sometimes, though, those stories or characters we connect with can tell us a bit about ourselves or what we’re going through. Is there a particular show or book that’s stood out to you recently?"

B: "Not really, I just watch whatever everyone’s talking about. It's mostly to keep up with conversations at work, honestly. Nothing too deep, just stuff to pass the time."

Round 4:
all scripts of A: 
A: "That makes sense, staying in the loop with what's popular. Sometimes, even when we're engaging with things on a surface level, they can still bring up unexpected perspectives or emotions. Has anything you watched or read sparked a thought or a feeling, even if it was subtle or momentary?"

all scripts of B: 
B: "I guess I just don't get too invested in any of it. It’s more about staying connected with people at work, having something to chat about during breaks, you know? Sometimes it feels like that's easier than getting into anything too personal."

Round 5:
all scripts of A: 
A: "It seems like staying connected with your coworkers through these shows and books is important to you. That sense of connection can be comforting, especially if it feels hard to dive into personal matters. I wonder, are there moments outside of work and conversations where you notice any thoughts or feelings quietly surfacing?"

all scripts of B: 
A: "It makes sense that it can be easier to talk about shows and books than dive into personal things. Building those connections at work can be important, even if they're more on the surface. I wonder if there are other areas of your life where you feel a similar balance between connecting with others and keeping things light."

B: "Yeah, I guess it's not just at work. I think a lot of people do that, keep things light to avoid dealing with too much."

Round 6:
all scripts of A: 
A: "It’s true, many of us do keep things light as a way to avoid diving too deep. It's a common way to protect ourselves. Sometimes, though, when we allow ourselves to peek beneath the surface, we discover insights or emotions that might surprise us. What do you think about exploring some of those deeper feelings together when you feel ready?"

all scripts of B: 
B: "I think it's pretty common, you know? Everyone has their stuff, and sometimes it just feels easier to hang out on the surface rather than dig deep."

Round 7:
all scripts of A: 
A: "I completely understand, and there's no rush to dive into anything before you're ready. Just know that I'm here to support you whenever you decide you want to explore those feelings. Meanwhile, if there's anything small that you'd like to chat about, whether it's related or not, I'm all ears."

all scripts of B: 
B: "Yeah, it's definitely common to keep things on the lighter side. Sometimes diving deep can feel overwhelming, and I'm not sure I'm ready for that just yet. Maybe we can focus on making the day-to-day things more manageable for now?"

Round 8:
all scripts of A: 
A: "Of course, we can absolutely focus on the day-to-day to make things feel more manageable. If there's an area of your routine or specific situations you find challenging, we can explore ways to make them a bit easier for you."

all scripts of B: 
B: "Yeah, I think focusing on making the day-to-day more manageable is a good idea for now. It feels like a safer place to start, without having to dive too deep into everything all at once."

Round 9:
all scripts of A: 
A: "Absolutely, starting with the day-to-day can create a solid foundation. Are there any particular areas or situations in your daily routine that you'd like to focus on first, perhaps something that feels a bit overwhelming or could use a little fine-tuning?"

all scripts of B: 
B: "Maybe we can talk about some time management or stress management techniques? Just to help keep the day-to-day stuff running smoothly without feeling too overwhelmed."
