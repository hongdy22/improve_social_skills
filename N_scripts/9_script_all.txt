Round 3:
all scripts of A: 
A: It’s wonderful how you find beauty in simplicity, B. Your perspective is always so grounding.

If you ever decide to explore more creatively, I’d love to swap ideas over some more of these lovely café chats.

all scripts of B: 
B: It's admirable how you're channeling your experiences into something creative, and I'm sure your adventures will resonate with many.
