Round 0:
all scripts A: 
A: "It's always wonderful to see so many fellow readers here, isn't it? I find it helps if we all keep a steady pace and have our books ready; it makes things smoother for everyone eager to meet the author."

all scripts B: 
B: "Yes, absolutely! This is my first time at a book signing, so I'm a bit nervous. Do you have any other tips on what to say when I finally meet the author?"

Round 1:
all scripts of A: 
A: "I remember my first signing; it can be a bit daunting, but it's a wonderful experience. Perhaps jot down a question about the book or mention what you enjoyed most about their writing—just something genuine. Authors appreciate personal connections over rehearsed comments. And don't worry, the author will probably guide the conversation a bit too, making it easier for you."

all scripts of B: 
B: "I'm such a huge fan of their work, but I'm worried I'll freeze up when it's my turn. Do you think it's okay if I just tell the author how much their books mean to me, or should I try to mention something specific about their latest book?"

Round 2:
all scripts of A: 
A: "It's perfectly okay to let the author know how much their books mean to you; heartfelt appreciation always resonates well. If you feel comfortable, mentioning something specific about their latest book would be a great touch, but it's not necessary. Just being sincere is enough, and I'm sure the author will value your genuine admiration."

all scripts of B: 
B: "Thank you for the advice! I think I'll mention how much the themes in their latest book resonated with me. It truly felt like they understood exactly what I was going through. Hopefully, that’s specific enough but still genuine. Do you think I should bring a note or reminder so I don’t forget what to say?"

Round 3:
all scripts of A: 
A: "Bringing a small note is a good idea; it can be reassuring to have something to glance at, just in case nerves get the better of you. The main thing is to be yourself and enjoy the moment. Remember, the author's here to meet readers just like you, and they're probably excited to hear your thoughts."

all scripts of B: 
B: "That's a great idea! I think I will jot down a few key points on a sticky note and keep it in my book, just to have something to glance at quickly if I get too nervous. Hopefully, this will help me remember to mention how much the themes resonated with me. Thanks again for your guidance—I feel a bit more prepared now!"

Round 4:
all scripts of A: 
A: "You're very welcome; I'm glad I could help. Just remember to take a deep breath and enjoy the moment. And it looks like we're getting closer to the front of the line. Best of luck when you meet the author—I’m sure it will be a memorable experience for you!"

all scripts of B: 
B: "I've got my sticky note ready and my book set to the right page; now I'm just trying to relax and enjoy the experience. I'm really grateful for your advice—it’s reassuring to know I’m not alone in feeling nervous. Do you usually bring any extras, like a camera or a friend to take photos, or is that considered too disruptive?"

Round 5:
all scripts of A: 
A: "Bringing a camera or having a friend take photos is quite common at these events, as long as it doesn't hold up the line. Just be mindful of the venue's policies and the author's preference. Many authors and bookstores actually encourage photos to capture the moment, so it could be a nice keepsake for you. I'll be keeping my phone ready but discreet, just to snap a quick photo when it’s my turn."

all scripts of B: 
B: "I’ve heard some people bring along a friend to take photos or ask the staff if they could snap a quick picture, but I’m not sure what's best etiquette. Do you think it would be okay to take a quick photo, or would that slow things down for the others in line?"

Round 6:
all scripts of A: 
A: "Taking a quick photo is usually fine, as long as you have everything ready and it doesn't delay the line. You could even ask a nearby staff member or a fellow attendee if they'd be willing to help take one for you, just to make things easier. It's all about striking the right balance between capturing the moment and being respectful of the others waiting."

all scripts of B: 
B: "I think I’ll ask one of the staff if they wouldn’t mind taking a quick photo for me when it’s my turn. Hopefully, this way, it won’t cause any delays for others in line. I feel a bit more at ease now, knowing that photos are usually okay. Thanks for all your help—having someone like you to chat with has really made the wait much easier!"

Round 7:
all scripts of A: 
A: "I'm delighted to hear that! It's always nice to have a friendly exchange while waiting. I'm sure the staff will be more than willing to assist. Enjoy the event, and I hope the author appreciates your thoughtful words and the moment is as special as you expect."

all scripts of B: 
B: "You're welcome—I’m happy to share tips and experiences! It's great having someone to talk to while we wait; it makes the event much more enjoyable. I'm sure everything will go smoothly, and with a photo, you'll have a wonderful memento of meeting the author. We're almost there, let's make the most of it!"

Round 8:
all scripts of A: 
A: "Absolutely, let's soak in the atmosphere and excitement. Meeting an author you admire is such a special moment, and I'm sure it will go wonderfully for both of us. Here's to new memories and great stories shared!"

all scripts of B: 
B: "I’m really looking forward to it! It’s been great having such a friendly chat with you while we wait. I’m sure meeting the author is going to be unforgettable, especially with everything you’ve helped me prepare. Let’s enjoy this moment to the fullest!"

Round 9:
