B: I appreciate the opportunity to clarify. From my perspective, it's essential to consider not only the financial contributions but also the time and energy that have been invested by family members who have had to handle more responsibilities, especially during tough periods. For instance, those who stayed close to home to support our parents while others pursued personal endeavors should be acknowledged.
