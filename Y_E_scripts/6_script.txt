Round 0:
A: It's wonderful to see such a great turnout for the book signing, isn't it? I find that sticking to the event's guidelines really helps keep things smooth for everyone waiting to meet the author. Are you looking forward to getting your book signed?
B: Yes, it’s really exciting to be here! It’s my first time at a book signing, and I’m a bit nervous about it. Do you have any tips on what I should say to the author or how long I should take when it's my turn? I don’t want to hold up the line or do something wrong.

Round 1:
A: You know, it really helps to keep your conversation brief and respectful. You might start by saying how much you appreciate the author’s work and maybe mention a favorite book or character. That way, the author gets to hear your enthusiasm, and the people behind us in line can move smoothly too. Just be yourself, and you'll do great!
B: Thank you, that's really helpful! I’m such a huge fan and didn't want to sound awkward or take up too much of the author’s time. I think I'll mention how their latest book really resonated with me. Is it okay to ask for a photo with the author, or is that usually discouraged?

Round 2:
A: Asking for a photo is usually okay, but I’d recommend observing how the event is flowing. If you see others taking photos and the author seems open to it, then a quick photo should be fine. Just be mindful of the line moving briskly. It sounds like you’re already being really thoughtful about your approach, which is great!
B: Thanks, I’ll definitely keep an eye on what others are doing and try to follow their lead. It’s reassuring to know that keeping things respectful and brief is the key. I hope the author appreciates hearing how much their work means to fans like us. It’s quite an experience just being here amidst all this excitement! I really appreciate your guidance.
