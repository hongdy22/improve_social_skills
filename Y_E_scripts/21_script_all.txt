Have you found any tricks that help you manage everything, or is it just a constant balancing act?

all scripts of B: 
B: It's pretty much a balancing act. Sometimes I try to make a schedule, but it feels like there’s just not enough time in the day. Plus, it’s hard to know where to start when everything seems important. I guess I worry about not doing well enough.

I'm sure you're doing better than you think, and I'm here to help if you ever need it.

Maybe we can brainstorm together some simple ways to make them a more regular part of your routine.

all scripts of B: 
Round 4:  
B: It's kind of hard to say. I guess I enjoy art and history, but sometimes I feel guilty spending time on them when there’s so much else to do.

So A would utter like that:  

A: It makes sense that you feel that way, and you're definitely not alone in that struggle. One thing that helped me was looking for small overlaps between what I needed to do and what I loved. Like when I had to study for history, I'd let myself get creative and draw timelines or maps. Maybe there's a way you can blend art or history into how you study other subjects too, starting little by little. It could make things feel a bit lighter, you know? We can think of some fun ways to try if you'd like.

all scripts of B: 
B: I like the idea of combining things I enjoy with what I have to study. Maybe sketching some historical figures or events while reviewing could help keep it interesting and less of a chore.
