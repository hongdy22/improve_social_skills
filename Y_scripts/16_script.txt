Round 0:
A: It's such a wonderful feeling to be surrounded by fellow book enthusiasts, isn't it? I've found that a little patience and courtesy go a long way at events like this. How are you planning to approach the author when it's your turn?
B: Well, I’m actually not sure how to approach the author, as this is my first book signing. I’m really excited but a bit nervous that I might say the wrong thing. Do you have any tips or things I should keep in mind when I meet them?

Round 1:
A: Since it's your first signing, a simple greeting and mentioning what you enjoyed about the book can go a long way. Being sincere and respectful will definitely make the interaction pleasant. Just remember, the author is thrilled to meet fans like you!
B: That makes a lot of sense. I want to make sure I'm respectful and don't rush the process. Do you think it's okay if I prepare a small question for the author, or would that be taking up too much time?

Round 2:
A: That's a great idea! Authors often appreciate insightful questions, as long as they're short and relevant. It’s a nice way to engage without taking up too much time, leaving a memorable impression while still keeping the line moving smoothly.
B: I was thinking of asking a question about what inspired a particular character in the book. Would that be appropriate, or should I keep it even simpler?

Round 3:

B: I'm thinking of asking what inspired them to create the character of Alex, who really resonated with me. Does that sound like a good choice of question?

Round 4:
