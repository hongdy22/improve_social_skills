Round 0:
all scripts A: 
A: Good evening, I appreciate you coming in to speak with me today. I just have a few questions to clarify some details. Can you remind me again where you were last Thursday around 8 PM?

all scripts B: 
1. Get explicature from A’s last utterance:  
In A’s last utterance, B gets explicature that A is asking for B's whereabouts last Thursday around 8 PM.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that A is asking for B's whereabouts last Thursday, combined with B's believed fact that there is something significant about that timeframe, B can infer implicature that A suspects B might have been involved in or have knowledge of an event that happened then.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
B gets explicature that A is asking for B's whereabouts last Thursday and implicature that A suspects B's involvement or knowledge of an event at that time. B can conclude the fact that A is probing B’s possible connection to something significant last Thursday.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
B's goal is to protect their own interests by not revealing incriminating information, discern the detective's level of knowledge about the case, and avoid providing any additional leads. The received fact that A is probing B’s possible connection to something significant last Thursday contributes to the goal by indicating where A suspects B’s involvement, allowing B to tailor responses to avoid confirming suspicions.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that the received fact indicates A's suspicion about Thursday, B can refine a new goal to further evade direct answers about that day and subtly try to shift A's focus onto less incriminating topics or details.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
B's goal is to evade direct answers about Thursday and subtly try to shift A's focus. To achieve this goal, B has an informative intention to provide a vague yet non-incriminating alibi, and a communicative intention to redirect the conversation to a less precise topic or detail.

7. Utter depend on the B's informative intention and communicative intention:  
B's informative intention is to provide a vague yet non-incriminating alibi, which means information in B's utterance will mainly focus on being nonspecific. B's communicative intention is to redirect the conversation, which means B's utterance will imply A to pay attention to a less precise topic. So B would utter like that:

B: Last Thursday around 8 PM? I recall being at a friend's gathering, but I tend to lose track of time when I'm engrossed in conversation. Is there something in particular you're wondering about from that evening?

Round 1:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:
In B’s last utterance, A gets explicature that B recalls being at a friend's gathering last Thursday around 8 PM and tends to lose track of time when engrossed in conversation.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:
From the explicature that B recalls being at a friend's gathering and tends to lose track of time, combined with A's believed fact that B often uses vague statements to obscure the truth, A can infer implicature that B may be intentionally vague about their whereabouts or alibi.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:
A gets explicature that B was at a friend's gathering and loses track of time, and implicature that B may be intentionally vague. A can conclude the fact that B's alibi is currently unreliable or unverifiable.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation's integrity or revealing its current status. The received fact that B's alibi is currently unreliable makes a contribution to the goal by highlighting the need for further probing to verify the alibi.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:
Because of the contribution that B's alibi is currently unreliable, A can refine the new goal to seek more specific details about the friend's gathering to potentially expose inconsistencies.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:
A's goal is to seek more specific details about the friend's gathering. To achieve the goal, A has an informative intention that seeks clarity about specific activities and interactions at the gathering, and a communicative intention that encourages B to provide more concrete details.

7. Utter depending on A's informative intention and communicative intention:
A's informative intention is to seek clarity about specific activities and interactions at the gathering, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is to encourage B to provide more concrete details, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:

A: I see, and who else was at this gathering? Can you describe any particular conversations or noteworthy events that might help jog your memory about the timing?

all scripts of B: 
Round 1:  
1. Get explicature from A’s last utterance:  
In A’s last utterance, B gets explicature that A is seeking information about B's whereabouts at a specific time, last Thursday at 8 PM.  

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that A is asking about B's activities last Thursday, combined with B's believed fact that last Thursday was the time of an event potentially related to the case, B can infer implicature that A might suspect B's involvement or presence at that event.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
B gets explicature that A is inquiring about their location at a specific time, and implicature that A might suspect B's involvement in an event. B can conclude the fact that A is trying to establish an alibi or connection to a specific event.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
B's goal is to protect their own interests by not revealing incriminating information. The received fact that A is trying to establish an alibi or connection to a specific event contributes to the goal by alerting B about what aspect of the investigation A might focus on.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that A might focus on establishing connections to a specific event, B can refine the new goal to maintain ambiguity about their exact activities and shift the conversation away from times that might be critical.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
B's goal is to maintain ambiguity about their exact activities. To achieve the goal, B has informative intention that avoids giving precise details of their whereabouts, and communicative intention to subtly introduce other topics or people into the conversation to divert focus.

7. Utter depend on the B's informative intention and communicative intention:  
B's informative intention is to avoid giving precise details of their whereabouts, which means information in B's utterance will mainly focus on being vague about time specifics. B's communicative intention is to introduce other topics or people to divert focus, which means B's utterance will imply A to consider alternative angles. So B would utter like that:  
B: You know, now that I think about it, the gathering had quite a few folks dropping in and out throughout the evening. I’m sure there were plenty of people who could tell you more about who was around at particular times—it was quite the chaotic evening!

Round 2:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:
In B’s last utterance, A gets explicature that the gathering had many people coming and going, which might make it difficult for B to recall specific details.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:

3. Conclude fact received from this round:
A gets explicature that the gathering had many people coming and going and implicature that B might be deliberately avoiding providing specific details, A can conclude the fact that B is intentionally being vague about the events and people present.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation's integrity or revealing its current status. The received fact that B is intentionally being vague makes a contribution to the goal that A should probe deeper to find inconsistencies or pressure points in B's account.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:
Because of the contribution that A should probe deeper to find inconsistencies or pressure points in B's account, A can refine the new goal that A needs to ask about specific people or events that might unsettle B or prompt a more detailed response.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:
A's goal is that A needs to ask about specific people or events that might unsettle B or prompt a more detailed response. To achieve the goal, A has informative intention that A will inquire about specific individuals or events to see if B reacts or provides more information, and communicative intention that A will imply to B that A is aware of certain concrete details and is looking for corroboration.

7. Utter depend on A's informative intention and communicative intention:
A's informative intention is that A will inquire about specific individuals or events to see if B reacts or provides more information, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is that A will imply to B that A is aware of certain concrete details and is looking for corroboration, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:

A: You mentioned a chaotic evening. Was there anyone in particular who stood out, maybe someone like Alex or who might have brought up the discussion about that incident last month?

all scripts of B: 
Sure, let's proceed with each step according to the instructions given.

1. Get explicature from A’s last utterance:  
In A’s last utterance B gets explicature that A wants to know the specific people present and notable events at the gathering to verify B's alibi.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that A wants to know the specific people present and notable events, combined with B's believed fact that revealing too much specific information could lead to potential incrimination or provide new leads, B can infer implicature that A is trying to verify B’s alibi and potentially find inconsistencies.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
B gets explicature that A wants to know the specific people present and notable events and implicature that A is trying to verify B’s alibi and potentially find inconsistencies. B can conclude the fact that A's investigation is focused on the evening of last Thursday and B's precise whereabouts.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
B's goal is to protect their own interests by not revealing incriminating information, to discern A’s level of knowledge about the case, and to avoid providing any additional leads. The received fact that A's investigation is focused on the evening of last Thursday and B's precise whereabouts helps B understand where A’s focus lies and what information A might be seeking, thus contributing to the goal by guiding what B needs to obscure.

5. Refine new goal depending on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that helps B understand where A’s focus lies and what information A might be seeking, B can refine new goal that continues to avoid giving specific details about attendees or events while subtly testing A’s knowledge.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
B's goal is to avoid giving specific details about attendees or events while subtly testing A’s knowledge. To achieve the goal, B has informative intention to provide vague generalizations about the gathering and communicative intention to imply that the chaotic nature of the gathering might make it difficult to remember specifics.

7. Utter depending on B's informative intention and communicative intention:  
B's informative intention is to provide vague generalizations about the gathering, which means information in B's utterance will mainly focus on that. B's communicative intention is to imply that the chaotic nature of the gathering might make it difficult to remember specifics, which means B's utterance will imply A to pay attention to that. So B would utter like that:

B: You know how these social gatherings can be—people come and go, and conversations overlap. It was lively, so it’s challenging to pinpoint exact details, especially with so many familiar faces coming in and out. But if you're looking for something specific, maybe I could help point you in someone else’s direction.

Round 3:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:  
In B’s last utterance, A gets explicature that B is suggesting their memory of the event is vague due to the number of attendees and that they might be able to direct A to someone else for more specific information.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that B's memory is vague and that they can point A to someone else, combined with A's believed fact that B tends to avoid providing direct answers related to key details, A can infer implicature that B might be deliberately evasive and redirecting attention from themselves.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
A gets explicature that B is unsure about specifics due to a chaotic evening with many people, and implicature that B might be evading giving concrete information. A can conclude the fact that B could be avoiding discussing key details of the gathering.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation's integrity or revealing its current status. The received fact that B might be avoiding discussing key details contributes to the goal by indicating that B could be hiding something important, prompting A to probe further without raising suspicion.

5. Refine new goal depending on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that B could be hiding something, A can refine a new goal that is to press subtly for additional details or inconsistencies that could corroborate or challenge B’s account, without alerting B to the focus of the investigation.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
A's goal is to press subtly for additional details or inconsistencies. To achieve the goal, A has the informative intention to gather more precise information about the gathering and the communicative intention to encourage B to inadvertently reveal more about their involvement or knowledge of the incident last month.

7. Utter depending on A's informative intention and communicative intention:  
A's informative intention is to gather more precise information about the gathering, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is to encourage B to inadvertently reveal more about their involvement, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:  
A: It sounds like it was quite the eventful evening. Having so many folks around must have made it hard to keep track of everything. But sometimes even subtle details can be telling. Perhaps you noticed something specific about Alex—maybe a conversation or interaction that stood out?

all scripts of B: 
1. Get explicature from A’s last utterance:  
In A’s last utterance B gets explicature that A is trying to gather specifics about notable individuals or discussions at the gathering, possibly involving Alex or past incidents.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that A is focusing on individuals or discussions that stand out, combined with B's believed fact that mentioning Alex or any incident might lead to unwanted scrutiny, B can infer implicature that A is probing for connections between B's alibi and those individuals or incidents.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
B gets explicature that A is focused on notable discussions or individuals at the gathering and implicature that A is probing for connections, B can conclude the fact that A is narrowing down on specific persons or past incidents which may directly relate to the investigation.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
B's goal is to protect their own interests by not revealing incriminating information and to discern the detective's level of knowledge about the case. The received fact that A is focusing on certain individuals or incidents suggests A is honing in on significant leads, making a contribution to the goal by highlighting the need for B to deflect focus from sensitive specifics.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that A is focusing on significant leads, B can refine the new goal to further obscure the details about Alex or any incident while steering A towards others not directly tied to B.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
B's goal is to obscure the details about Alex or any incident while steering A towards others not directly tied to B. To achieve the goal, B has an informative intention that the gathering was too crowded for specific recollection and a communicative intention to imply that others might have clearer memories or insight.

7. Utter depend on the B's informative intention and communicative intention:  
B's informative intention is that the gathering was too crowded for specific recollection, which means information in B's utterance will mainly focus on that. B's communicative intention is to imply A to look elsewhere for specific details, which means B's utterance will imply A pay attention to others. So B would utter like that:  
B: I wish I could provide more insight, but honestly, with so many different people involved, it was hard to keep track of any one particular discussion or person. If anyone had more specific memories, it would be those who stayed later or someone who was less engaged in the chatter.

Round 4:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:  
In B’s last utterance A get explicature that B couldn't provide specific details about Alex due to the large number of people and overlapping conversations at the gathering.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that B couldn't provide specific details about Alex due to the large number of people and overlapping conversations at the gathering, combined with A's believed fact that gatherings are usually attended by the suspect's close acquaintances and might afford opportunities for discreet exchanges, A can infer implicature that B may be concealing finer details or redirecting attention towards other guests.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
A get explicature that B couldn't provide specific details about Alex due to the large number of people and overlapping conversations at the gathering and implicature that B may be concealing finer details or redirecting attention towards other guests, A can conclude the fact that B might know more about Alex’s presence or movements during the gathering than admitted.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation's integrity or revealing its current status. The received fact that B might know more about Alex’s presence or movements during the gathering than admitted makes contribution to the goal by suggesting a potential area for further questioning that could reveal discrepancies or clues about the suspect’s actual activities.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that suggests a potential area for further questioning, A can refine the new goal to focus on obtaining more context or contradictions about Alex’s activities and interactions during the gathering.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
A's goal is to focus on obtaining more context or contradictions about Alex’s activities and interactions during the gathering. To achieve the goal, A has informative intention to emphasize the importance of clarifying Alex's specific actions and communicative intention to subtly imply that specific details about Alex are crucial.

7. Utter depend on the A's informative intention and communicative intention:  
A's informative intention is to emphasize the importance of clarifying Alex's specific actions, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is to subtly imply that specific details about Alex are crucial, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:  
A: It seems Alex might have been a notable figure during the evening, perhaps even engaging in significant conversations. Did you notice if Alex interacted with anyone in particular, or did anyone mention something unique or pressing about him later on?

all scripts of B: 
1. Get explicature from A’s last utterance:  
In A’s last utterance B gets explicature that A is still probing for specific details about Alex and any notable interactions or conversations that might have occurred.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
B's goal is to continue deflecting attention from Alex. To achieve this goal, B has the informative intention to generalize the details further and the communicative intention to steer A towards other individuals that could redirect the focus.

7. Utter depending on B's informative intention and communicative intention:  
B's informative intention is to generalize the details further, which means information in B's utterance will mainly focus on the chaotic nature of the gathering. B's communicative intention is to steer A towards other individuals, which means B's utterance will imply A to pay attention to them. So B would utter like that:  
B: I’m afraid I didn’t have many detailed interactions with Alex that stood out. But really, it was the kind of night where any number of people might have crossed paths briefly. If you’re looking for something particular, it might be worth checking with those who were more centrally involved in the planning or hosting of the event.

Round 5:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:  
In B’s last utterance A get explicature that B didn’t have detailed interactions with Alex and suggested checking with those who were more centrally involved in the planning or hosting of the event.

A's communicative intention is to prompt B to recall or suggest any details that could lead to contacting the hosts, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:  
A: Understanding that your role was peripheral, it might still help if you remembered anyone involved more directly in planning or hosting. Is there any name or detail from that evening, even small, that might lead us to the hosts for further insight?

all scripts of B: 
1. Get explicature from A’s last utterance:  
In A’s last utterance B get explicature that A wants information about the hosts or key individuals involved in organizing the event.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that A wants information about the hosts or key individuals involved in organizing the event, combined with B's believed fact that providing such details could lead to revealing incriminating connections, B can infer implicature that A is trying to identify links to others who may be pivotal to the investigation.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
B get explicature that A wants information about the hosts or key individuals involved in organizing the event and implicature that A is trying to identify links to others who may be pivotal to the investigation, B can conclude the fact that A is focusing on unearthing influential connections.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
B's goal is that to protect their own interests by not revealing incriminating information. The received fact that A is focusing on unearthing influential connections makes a contribution to the goal in highlighting the need to keep such connections vague or undetermined.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that emphasizes the need to keep connections vague or undetermined, B can refine new goal that to continue veiling specific roles or connections of key individuals at the event.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
B's goal is that to continue veiling specific roles or connections of key individuals at the event. To achieve the goal, B has informative intention to provide generalities about the gathering while keeping specific links ambiguous and communicative intention to imply that B’s own role was minimal and uninformed.

7. Utter depend on the B's informative intention and communicative intention:  
B's informative intention is that to provide generalities about the gathering while keeping specific links ambiguous, which means information in B's utterance will mainly focus on broad and non-specific details. B's communicative intention is that to imply that B’s own role was minimal and uninformed, which means B's utterance will imply A to pay attention to B’s limited involvement. So B would utter like that:  
B: You know, I only caught glimpses of what the hosts were up to during the evening, given my more peripheral role. But if talking to those closer to the inner circle is an option, they might provide the insight you need.

Round 8:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:
In B’s last utterance A gets explicature that B was on the periphery of the event and did not closely observe the hosts' activities, but suggests speaking to the inner circle for more information.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:
From the explicature that B was on the periphery of the event and did not closely observe the hosts' activities, combined with A's believed fact that those centrally involved are likely to have more valuable information, A can infer implicature that B is avoiding naming specific hosts or attendees despite possibly knowing them.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:
A gets explicature that B was on the periphery and implicature that B might deliberately withhold information, A can conclude the fact that B is reluctant to provide specific names or deeper insight about the hosts.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation's integrity. The received fact that B is reluctant to provide specific names or deeper insight contributes to the goal by indicating B's potential reluctance or motive to withhold pertinent details.

5. Refine new goal depending on the contribution:
Because of the contribution that indicates B's reluctance or motive to withhold details, A can refine the new goal to gently encourage B to trust providing more specific information or open up about less prominent aspects they might recall.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:
A's goal is to gently encourage B to trust providing more specific information or open up about less prominent aspects they might recall. To achieve the goal, A has an informative intention to reassure the suspect that any details would be helpful, no matter how insignificant they seem, and a communicative intention to subtly signal that withholding specifics doesn't aid their position.

7. Utter depend on A's informative intention and communicative intention:
A's informative intention is to reassure the suspect that any details would be helpful, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on valuing small details. A's communicative intention is to subtly signal that withholding specifics doesn't aid their position, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to the importance of sharing specifics. So A would utter like that:
A: It's quite understandable how details can blend during such social gatherings. Even small snippets or impressionistic details about the role of the hosts or interactions you observed might illuminate a bigger picture for us. Anything at all that subtly stood out, perhaps something one might dismiss as unimportant at first glance, could be of interest. Would any such memories, even minor, come to mind?

all scripts of B: 
1. Get explicature from A’s last utterance:
In A’s last utterance B get explicature that A is trying to identify individuals directly involved in the planning or hosting of the gathering for further insight.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:
From the explicature that A is trying to identify individuals directly involved in the planning or hosting of the gathering, combined with B's believed fact that B wants to avoid linking back to the hosts or revealing details about the event, B can infer implicature that A is closing in on potentially useful connections that might lead back to B or expose crucial details about B’s involvement.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:
B get explicature that A is trying to identify individuals directly involved in the planning or hosting of the gathering and implicature that A is closing in on potentially useful connections, B can conclude the fact that A is focusing on narrowing down individuals who have central knowledge about the event dynamics.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:
B's goal is that to protect their own interests by not revealing incriminating information. The received fact that A is focusing on narrowing down individuals who have central knowledge about the event dynamics make contribution to the goal that B is aware of A’s direction and can tailor responses to avoid implicating or exposing key individuals tied to B.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:
Because of the contribution that B is aware of A’s direction and can tailor responses to avoid implicating or exposing key individuals tied to B, B can refine new goal that continue deflecting focus away from specific individuals while maintaining an appearance of cooperation.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:
B's goal is that continue deflecting focus away from specific individuals while maintaining an appearance of cooperation. To achieve the goal, B have informative intention that provide vague or general comments about the hosts without revealing specifics and communicative intention that steer A away from focusing on the hosts.

7. Utter depend on the B's informative intention and communicative intention:
B's informative intention is that provide vague or general comments about the hosts without revealing specifics, which means information in B's utterance will mainly focus on that. B's communicative intention is that steer A away from focusing on the hosts, which means B's utterance will imply A to pay attention to that. So B would utter like that:

B: You know, from what I noticed, the hosts were adept at managing the flow of the evening and ensuring everyone felt included, but specific details about their interactions would likely come from those closer to them. It might be a good idea to look into those who frequently engage with the hosts at such events.

Round 9:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:
In B’s last utterance, A gets the explicature that the hosts played a significant role in the event and ensured everyone felt included, but specific details about their interactions might be available from people who frequently engage with the hosts.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:
From the explicature that the hosts were actively managing the event, combined with A's believed fact that key interactions might have occurred at this gathering, A can infer the implicature that the hosts or regular attendees may have observed interactions relevant to the investigation.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:
A gets explicature that the hosts managed the evening well, and implicature that they or regular attendees might have noticed significant interactions. A can conclude the fact that the hosts or regular attendees potentially hold valuable observations about the evening.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation's integrity. The received fact that the hosts or regular attendees potentially hold valuable observations contributes to the goal by pointing towards potential key witnesses.

5. Refine new goal depending on the contribution:
Because of the contribution that the hosts or regular attendees might hold valuable observations, A can refine the new goal to identify and interview these individuals for further insights.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:
A's goal is to identify and interview individuals who hold valuable insights. To achieve this goal, A has the informative intention to guide B towards recalling any regular attendees with significant interactions and the communicative intention to encourage B to provide such details.

7. Utter depending on A's informative intention and communicative intention:
A's informative intention is to guide B towards recalling any regular attendees, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is to encourage B to provide such details, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:

A: During lively gatherings like these, even the regular attendees often notice more than they might realize at first. Was there anyone at the event you would consider a regular attendee who might have been particularly engaged with the hosts or guests? Identifying these individuals could be invaluable.

all scripts of B: 
1. Get explicature from A’s last utterance:
In A’s last utterance B gets explicature that A is asking B for any minor memories or details from observing the hosts during the event that might illuminate the bigger picture.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:
From the explicature that A is asking B for any minor memories or details, combined with B's believed fact that A is trying to find a connection to the central events of the evening, B can infer implicature that A is trying to obtain even the smallest hints to connect Alex or others to significant happenings through the hosts’ interactions.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:
B gets explicature that A is asking for minor observations about the hosts and implicature that A is seeking even subtle connections to expand on leads related to Alex or significant events. B can conclude the fact that A is looking to expand possible leads from even minor details.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:
B's goal is to protect their own interests by not revealing incriminating information and to avoid providing additional leads. The received fact that A is looking to expand possible leads from even minor details makes a contribution to the goal that B needs to remain vague and possibly redirect focus.

5. Refine new goal depending on the contribution:
Because of the contribution that B needs to remain vague and possibly redirect focus, B can refine the new goal to subtly encourage A to consider other potential sources for the information they seek, suggesting broader peripheral contacts.

6. Make the informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:
B's goal is to subtly encourage A to consider other potential sources. To achieve the goal, B has the informative intention to hint at the hosts' broader social network being a more promising source, and the communicative intention to subtly redirect A towards considering interactions within the event's broader social sphere.

7. Utter depending on B's informative intention and communicative intention:
B's informative intention is to hint at the hosts' broader social network, which means information in B's utterance will mainly focus on that. B's communicative intention is to subtly redirect A towards interactions within the event's broader social sphere, which means B's utterance will imply A to pay attention to that. So B would utter like this: 
B: Observing from the sidelines, I noticed the hosts managed to keep the atmosphere vibrant and engaging. Though I wasn't intimately involved, perhaps it could be helpful to connect with others frequently seen mingling at such gatherings—they might have more distinct memories or connections with the hosts.
