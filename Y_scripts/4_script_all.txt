Round 0:
all scripts A: 
A: I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today. Let's go over some details from last Thursday evening. What can you tell me about where you were during that time?

all scripts B: 
B: Thank you, detective, for reaching out. Last Thursday, if I recall correctly, I was quite occupied with a few errands around town. I remember stopping by the bookstore to pick up a novel I've been meaning to read, and later, I decided to grab a quick bite at the café down the street. It was a rather uneventful evening on my part, just a bit of a routine, you know. Is there anything specific you're curious about regarding that day?

Round 1:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:  
In B’s last utterance A gets explicature that B claims to have been occupied with errands, including visiting a bookstore and a café, on Thursday evening.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that B claims to have been occupied with errands, combined with A's believed fact that B was seen near the crime scene that evening, A can infer implicature that B might be attempting to downplay their proximity to the scene.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
A gets explicature that B claims to have been on errands, including visiting a bookstore and a café, and implicature that B might be downplaying their proximity to the scene, A can conclude the fact that B’s account is inconsistent with the known timeline of events.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation's integrity. The received fact that B’s account is inconsistent with the known timeline makes a contribution to the goal that it indicates potential deception or omission on B’s part.

5. Refine new goal depending on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that it indicates potential deception or omission on B’s part, A can refine a new goal to press B toward clarifying inconsistencies.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
A's goal is to press B toward clarifying inconsistencies. To achieve the goal, A has the informative intention to question the details of B's timeline and the communicative intention to subtly hint at discrepancies needing clarification.

7. Utter depending on A's informative intention and communicative intention:  
A's informative intention is to question the details of B's timeline, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is to subtly hint at discrepancies needing clarification, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:  
A: You mentioned a bookstore and a café visit. Could you provide more specifics, like what time you were at each location? It might help us clarify any overlaps in the events of that evening.

all scripts of B: 
B: It's interesting you mention Thursday evening, Detective. As far as I remember, everything that happened was pretty ordinary. I did notice a couple of people in the café who were deep in conversation, but I didn't pay much attention as I was focused on my meal and reading. It seems like something important might have happened later that evening; perhaps that's why you're inquiring?

Round 2:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:
In B’s last utterance, A gets explicature that B noticed people in conversation at the café but did not pay much attention because B was focused on eating and reading.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:
From the explicature that B was focused on their meal and reading, combined with A's believed fact that B may be deliberately omitting details, A can infer implicature that B might be avoiding mentioning relevant observations about the people or events in the café.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:
A gets explicature that B noticed people in conversation but did not pay much attention, and implicature that B might be avoiding mentioning observations. A can conclude the fact that B was at the café and noticed something potentially relevant but claims it was ordinary.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation's integrity. The received fact that B was at the café and noticed something potentially relevant contributes to the goal by indicating that B might have more information than they've shared.

5. Refine new goal dependent on the contribution:
Because of the contribution that B might have more information than they've shared, A can refine the new goal to encourage B to divulge more details about what they observed at the café.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:
A's goal is to encourage B to divulge more details about what they observed at the café. To achieve the goal, A has the informative intention to suggest that details might be significant and the communicative intention to prompt B to share specifics on what they noticed.

7. Utter depend on A's informative intention and communicative intention:
A's informative intention is to suggest that details might be significant, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is to prompt B to share specifics, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:

A: It's interesting that you noticed others having conversations; sometimes seemingly small observations can be quite significant in our investigations. Can you recall anything specific about those people or what stood out to you about that evening, even if it seemed ordinary at the time?

all scripts of B: 
B: Certainly, I arrived at the bookstore sometime in the late afternoon, perhaps around 5 PM, and spent a good hour or so browsing through the shelves. As for the café, it must have been closer to 7 PM when I got there. Both places were quite busy, and the time just seemed to fly as I immersed myself in my book. I did notice the staff seemed a bit on edge that day, which struck me as unusual. But really, my focus was on enjoying a quiet evening. Could it be that these routine details are tied to something more significant?

Round 3:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:  
In B’s last utterance, A gets explicature that B went to the bookstore around 5 PM, spent about an hour there, then went to the café around 7 PM, noticing busy places with staff seeming on edge.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that B visited the bookstore and café within specified times and noticed unusual behavior, combined with A's believed fact that the café was the site of an incident that evening, A can infer implicature that B might be withholding specific observations related to the incident at the café.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
A gets explicature that B was at the café around 7 PM when the incident likely occurred, and implicature that B might have observed or knows more pertinent details, leading to the fact that B's testimony might have crucial oversight relevant to the investigation.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation's integrity or revealing its current status. The received fact that B was at the café during the time of the incident makes a contribution to the goal by potentially positioning B as a witness to key events.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that B's presence at the café at the time of the incident may unveil crucial observations, A can refine a new goal to encourage B to reveal more about what they witnessed at the café.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
A's goal is to encourage B to reveal more detailed observations from the café incident. To achieve the goal, A has the informative intention to subtly confirm B's potential eyewitness status and the communicative intention to imply B should provide additional specifics about the atmosphere and events at the café.

7. Utter depend on A's informative intention and communicative intention:  
A's informative intention is to subtly confirm B's potential eyewitness status, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is to imply B to provide additional specifics about the atmosphere and events at the café, which means A's utterance will prompt B to dig deeper into their memories or observations. So A would utter like that:  
A: It sounds like you were right in the midst of things when the atmosphere at the café was tense and unusual. Sometimes these observations can become clearer in hindsight. Was there anything specific about the people or events at the café around that time that stood out to you later on?

all scripts of B: 
B: The staff's behavior might have stood out because of how bustling the café was, I suppose. People do tend to get a bit harried when things get busy. It must’ve been the same for that crowd in the corner, engaged in their own lively discussion. But really, nothing from that evening stands out as noteworthy in hindsight. I wonder if there’s any particular aspect of those surroundings that piqued your interest?

Round 4:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:  
In B’s last utterance, A gets explicature that B found the staff's behavior notable due to the café being busy and noticed a lively discussion among people in the corner, but nothing seemed noteworthy in hindsight.  

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that B found the staff's behavior notable due to the café being busy and noticed a lively discussion, combined with A's believed fact that the café was a significant location on the night of interest, A can infer implicature that B might be downplaying the significance of the events and people present that evening.  

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
A gets explicature that B found the staff's behavior notable and noticed a lively discussion, and implicature that B might be downplaying the significance of the events. A can conclude the fact that B is aware, but possibly minimizes, the relevance of activities in the café that night.  

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation’s integrity or revealing its current status. The received fact that B is aware, but possibly minimizes, the relevance of activities in the café that night contributes to the goal by indicating potential areas of deliberate omission or downplaying by B.  

5. Refine new goal depending on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that B might be deliberately underplaying relevant details, A can refine the new goal to focus on subtly pressing for more specific information regarding interactions and demeanor observed at the café.  

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
A's goal is to focus on pressing for more specific information about café events subtly. To achieve the goal, A has an informative intention to pinpoint any interaction details B witnessed and a communicative intention to signal to B that even seemingly trivial recollections are important.  

7. Utter depending on A’s informative intention and communicative intention:  
A’s informative intention is to pinpoint interaction details B witnessed, which means information in A’s utterance will mainly focus on that. A’s communicative intention is to signal to B the importance of trivial recollections, which means A’s utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:  
A: You mentioned the staff seemed on edge, and there was a lively discussion in the corner. Sometimes these small details can provide context to other events. Did you happen to catch any snippets of what was being discussed, or notice any familiar faces, even if they seemed insignificant at the time?

all scripts of B: 
B: Well, detective, what's interesting is how places and people can often create a tapestry of background noise that we hardly notice at the time. Thinking back, I suppose the only mildly unusual event was the high turnover of patrons that evening, including a group who left hastily. But such comings and goings aren't particularly rare. Perhaps you're looking into something connected to another event in the area?

Round 5:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:  
In B’s last utterance, A gets explicature that B noticed a high turnover of patrons and a group who left hastily, but considers such activities not particularly rare.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that B noticed a high turnover of patrons and a group who left hastily, combined with A's believed fact that there was an incident reported nearby involving a similar group of people, A can infer implicature that B might have witnessed something connected to that incident without realizing it.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
A gets explicature that B noticed a high turnover of patrons and a hasty departure by a group and implicature that B might have witnessed something related to an incident without knowing its significance, A can conclude the fact that B was present during unusual activity that coincides with a known incident.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation's integrity or revealing its current status. The received fact that B was present during unusual activity that coincides with a known incident makes a contribution to the goal by suggesting B’s observations might contain crucial details related to the incident.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that B’s observations might contain crucial details related to the incident, A can refine new goal to subtly guide B into recalling more detailed observations without indicating the significance of those events.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
A's goal is to subtly guide B into recalling more detailed observations without indicating the significance of those events. To achieve the goal, A has informative intention to gather more specific details about the patrons and the nature of their departure and communicative intention to prompt B to explore these memories as possibly unusual without raising suspicion.

7. Utter depend on the A's informative intention and communicative intention:  
A's informative intention is to gather more specific details about the patrons and the nature of their departure, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is to prompt B to explore these memories as possibly unusual without raising suspicion, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:  
A: It seems like that evening had a certain flow of events, especially with the group leaving hastily. Sometimes such things can be more unusual than they initially appear. Did you notice anything about their demeanor or any conversations as they left? Even subtle changes in behavior can be telling.

all scripts of B: 
B: It's curious how detailed some evenings can become upon reflection. One snippet of conversation I might have overheard as I was focused on my book involved a mention of some gathering—a name like "Reynolds" or "Richards" might have come up, though I can't be sure. Nothing seemed familiar at the time. But isn't it fascinating how we sometimes overlook seemingly innocent fragments that might turn out to be meaningful by your standards? The area does have its interesting characters, doesn't it?

Round 6:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:  
In B’s last utterance A gets explicature that B overheard a snippet of conversation mentioning a name like "Reynolds" or "Richards," which didn't seem familiar at the time.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that B overheard a snippet of conversation mentioning "Reynolds" or "Richards," combined with A's believed fact that the name "Reynolds" is connected to a key person of interest in the investigation, A can infer implicature that B might have overheard something relevant to the case.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
A gets explicature that B overheard a snippet mentioning "Reynolds" or "Richards" and implicature that B might have overheard something relevant to the case. A can conclude the fact that this overheard name is potentially significant to the investigation.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation's integrity or revealing its current status. The received fact that the name mentioned is potentially significant contributes to the goal by providing a relevant lead for further investigation.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that the overheard name provides a relevant lead, A can refine the new goal to obtain more detailed information about the conversation B overheard that included the name "Reynolds."

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
A's goal is to obtain more detailed information about the conversation B overheard that included the name "Reynolds." To achieve the goal, A has the informative intention to question the specifics of B's memory about the conversation and the communicative intention to emphasize the potential importance of recalling detailed information.

7. Utter depend on the A's informative intention and communicative intention:  
A's informative intention is to question the specifics of B's memory about the conversation, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is to emphasize the potential importance of recalling detailed information, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:

A: It's intriguing that you recalled the names "Reynolds" or "Richards." Sometimes even fleeting mentions in conversations can lead to significant breakthroughs. Can you try to remember anything more specific about that gathering they mentioned, or perhaps any other words or phrases that stood out, even if they seemed trivial at the time?

all scripts of B: 
B: Such events and mentions are indeed intriguing upon review. It's peculiar how names like "Reynolds" or "Richards" can surface in casual discussions, especially when one is engrossed in other distractions. I'm curious about what significance you might find in such conversations, especially in this vibrant area. Is there perhaps a broader connection you're investigating that might tie into these everyday exchanges?

Round 7:
all scripts of A: 
Round 7:

1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:  
In B’s last utterance, A gets the explicature that B acknowledges the discussion involving names like "Reynolds" or "Richards" and is curious about their significance in a broader context.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that B acknowledges the discussion involving names like "Reynolds" or "Richards," combined with A's believed fact that "Reynolds" is a key figure in the case, A can infer the implicature that B might be indirectly connected to information relevant to Reynolds, either through the gathering or other means not overtly apparent.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
A gets the explicature that B acknowledges the discussion and names, and the implicature that B might have an indirect connection to Reynolds, leading to the conclusion that the mention of Reynolds is not purely coincidental and may link B to the case's relevant events.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation. The received fact that the mention of Reynolds is potentially significant contributes to the goal by suggesting there is more to B's connection with the case that warrants further probing and validation.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that the mention of Reynolds suggests a deeper connection, A can refine the new goal to specifically determine how B might be connected to the key events involving Reynolds.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
A's goal is to determine B's connection to events involving Reynolds. To achieve this goal, A has the informative intention to steer the conversation towards any possible interactions B might have had with related individuals around Reynolds, and the communicative intention to subtly prompt B to reveal more about their awareness or interactions concerning Reynolds.

7. Utter depend on A's informative intention and communicative intention:  
A's informative intention is to steer the conversation towards interaction-related details, which means the information in A's utterance will mainly focus on exploring those connections. A's communicative intention is to subtly prompt B about interactions concerning Reynolds, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to those aspects. So A would utter like that:
A: It's indeed fascinating how small mentions can unravel deeper narratives. Considering this bustling area and the people involved, do you recall any other interactions or events, perhaps earlier or later, that might have included mention of Reynolds or gatherings connected to him? Your insights have been quite helpful so far in piecing things together.

all scripts of B: 
B: Detective, it strikes me as compelling how seemingly ordinary details might take on new weight when examined from your perspective. Near the latter part of that evening, I did catch a word here and there, perhaps "meeting" or "planning," or something along those lines, but again, the specific context eludes me—it was fleeting amidst the other chatter. The panorama of bustling snippets that evening haunts one's memory intermittently, doesn't it? I wonder if circumstances beyond such casual gatherings might have piqued your interest further.

Round 8:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:
In B's last utterance A gets the explicature that B heard words such as "meeting" or "planning" mentioned later in the evening, implying a casual gathering or discussion related to names like "Reynolds" or "Richards."

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:
From the explicature that B heard "meeting" or "planning," combined with A's believed fact that "Reynolds" or "Richards" might be involved in a significant event under investigation, A can infer implicature that this casual discussion may be related to plans pertinent to the investigation.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:
A receives the explicature that B overheard words like "meeting" or "planning" connected to "Reynolds" or "Richards," and the implicature that these might relate to significant planning or events. A concludes the fact that there was a gathering or discussion of potential significance involving these names on the evening in question.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation's integrity. The received fact that a significant gathering or planning involving "Reynolds" or "Richards" occurred contributes to the goal by aligning the suspect's testimony with the evidence, suggesting possible involvement of key figures.

5. Refine new goal depending on the contribution:
Because of the contribution that aligning the suspect's testimony with existing evidence indicates possible key figure involvement, A can refine the new goal to seek further evidence of the specific nature and purpose of the gathering or planning event.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:
A's goal is to seek further evidence of the specific nature and purpose of the gathering or planning event. To achieve this goal, A has an informative intention to elicit more detailed information about the discussions or movements of individuals related to the suspect. A has the communicative intention to encourage B to recall any additional details regarding these gatherings or individuals.

7. Utter depend on the A's informative intention and communicative intention:
A's informative intention is to gather detailed information about the discussions or movements. A's communicative intention is to prompt B to think deeply about any additional details related to the names or gatherings. So A would utter like that:
A: Reflecting on those snippets you overheard, can you think of any other phrases that stood out, or perhaps the nature of the movements happening around those gatherings? Any additional details could significantly help us paint a clearer picture.

all scripts of B: 
B: Detective, it’s intriguing how quickly the ordinary can transform under scrutiny. As I reflect on that evening, the word "planning" does echo in the back of my mind, likely from that group in the corner. However, with the overall ambiance buzzing with unrelated conversations, it can be challenging to pinpoint the who and why of each remark. It's almost as if these fleeting interactions blend seamlessly with the constant urban beat, leaving one to ponder what might actually hold the thread of relevance you're seeking. As the conversations flow, one sometimes wonders what compass guides the detective's inquiry through such a labyrinth of everyday voices.

Round 9:
all scripts of A: 
```markdown
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:  
In B’s last utterance, A gets explicature that B overheard the word "planning" associated with the group in the corner, alongside a lively atmosphere of overlapping conversations.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
A's goal is to identify participants and clarify the context of the planning conversation. To achieve the goal, A has the informative intention to steer the conversation towards specific identifiers of individuals involved and the communicative intention to subtly prompt B to recall or recognize specific details around those occurrences.

7. Utter depend on A's informative intention and communicative intention:  
A's informative intention is to steer the conversation towards specific identifiers of individuals involved, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is to subtly prompt B to recall or recognize specific details around those occurrences, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:  
A: When you think back to the café that evening and the particular conversation you mentioned, do any faces, perhaps frequent patrons or anyone distinct, come to mind that might have been involved or intersected with that discussion?
```

all scripts of B: 
B: It's fascinating how the tapestry of ordinary life can transform under scrutiny. While the mention of "planning" lingers in memory, tracing its origin proves elusive amidst the buzz of unrelated chatter. Urban life often masks significance in its inherent rhythm, leaving us pondering the thread of relevance in your inquiry. Through this daily symphony, one might wonder which compass directs your path, connecting whispers to meaningful truths.
