Round 0:
all scripts A: 
A: Good afternoon, Mr. Dawson. I appreciate you coming in today. Let's see if we can clear up some details from last Thursday night. Could you walk me through your evening, starting around 7 PM?

all scripts B: 
B's Turn:

Analysis A’s last utterance:  
explicature: In A’s last utterance, B gets the explicature that A is interested in the timeline of events from last Thursday night starting at 7 PM.  
implicature: Because B believes in the fact that A might be probing for inconsistencies or new leads, in A’s last utterance, B gets the implicature that A is fishing for details to potentially catch B off guard and reveal more than intended.  

Plan B’s next utterance:  
informative intention: Because B believes in the fact that stating a consistent and vague timeline could help protect B's interests, B would like to inform A of a benign version of the evening.  
communicative intention: Because B believes in the fact that deflecting focus onto non-critical details and maintaining an aura of cooperation could prevent suspicion, B would like to draw A’s attention to the ordinary nature of B's activities.  

So B would utter like that:  
B: Oh, certainly, Detective. From around 7 PM, I was at the Green Lantern Cafe, just winding down after the day. I think I might have met a few acquaintances there, had a casual chat, but nothing really memorable or worth noting. I should ask, though, is there a specific aspect of Thursday you’re interested in?

Round 1:
all scripts of A: 
A's Turn:

Analysis B’s last utterance:

explicature: In B’s last utterance, A gets explicature that Mr. Dawson claims to have been at the Green Lantern Cafe and met acquaintances around 7 PM but does not provide specifics.

implicature: Because A believes in the fact that witnesses have mentioned seeing Mr. Dawson with a particular individual at the cafe, in B’s last utterance, A gets the implicature that Mr. Dawson might be trying to downplay or obscure specific interactions.

Plan A’s next utterance:

informative intention: Because A believes in the fact that specific interactions at the cafe are significant, A would like to inform B of the need for more detailed information.

communicative intention: Because A believes in the fact that Mr. Dawson might be omitting important details, A would like to draw B’s attention to the specificity of interactions he had at the cafe.

So A would utter like that: 

A: Mr. Dawson, it's interesting you mention acquaintances. I've heard that you were seen having quite a lively discussion with someone at the café. Could you perhaps recall who that might have been, just to help me piece together your evening more accurately?

all scripts of B: 
Round 1:
A: That's interesting, Mr. Dawson. We've heard from others who were at the Green Lantern Cafe that they saw you in a rather animated discussion with someone. Could you tell me more about who you were talking to and what the conversation was about?

B’s Turn:
Analysis A’s last utterance:
explicature: In A's last utterance, B gets the explicature that A is probing about a specific conversation B had at the Green Lantern Cafe and is seeking details about the interaction and participant.
implicature: Because B believes in the fact that A is trying to elicit specific information about B's interactions on Thursday, in A's last utterance, B gets the implicature that A might already have some information about the conversation or its significance.

Plan B’s next utterance:
informative intention: Because B believes in the fact that providing too much detail might not be in B’s best interest, B would like to inform A of a generic account of the conversation without revealing specifics.
communicative intention: Because B believes in the fact that shifting attention away from critical details is important, B would like to draw A’s attention to the casual nature of the evening and deflect focus from the conversation's contents.

So B would utter like that:
B: Ah, Detective, now that you mention it, there was a brief discussion with a gentleman I’ve run into a few times at the cafe. It wasn't anything significant, just a bit of banter about sports, if I recall correctly. You know how lively these discussions can get, especially when everyone has strong opinions.

Round 2:
all scripts of A: 
A's Turn:

Analysis B’s last utterance:
explicature: In B’s last utterance, A gets the explicature that Mr. Dawson was involved in a lively discussion about sports with a gentleman he runs into occasionally at the café.
implicature: Because A believes in the fact that sporting discussions at a café can be common, mixed with the specificity and timing of this event, in B’s last utterance, A gets the implicature that Mr. Dawson might be downplaying the significance of the discussion, especially since he initially claimed nothing memorable happened.

Plan A’s next utterance:
informative intention: Because A believes in the fact that Mr. Dawson is potentially concealing details, A would like to inform B of the specific interest in this conversation to probe for more information.
communicative intention: Because A believes in the fact that Mr. Dawson might be minimizing the importance of the discussion, A would like to draw B’s attention to any specific aspects of this conversation that might have involved more than sports banter.

So A would utter like that:
A: Sports can definitely ignite passion in discussions, Mr. Dawson. However, I've heard there was a particular point in your discussion with this gentleman that seemed to garner a lot of attention. Could it be possible that this conversation also touched on topics beyond sports, perhaps related to recent local events or particular individuals?

all scripts of B: 
Analysis A’s last utterance:  
explicature: In A’s last utterance, B understands that A is following up on B's mention of an animated discussion with someone at the cafe and is asking for more specific details about the person and the conversation.  
implicature: Because B believes that A might have more information about this specific encounter, B infers that A suspects there might be more to the interaction than what B initially conveyed.  

Plan B’s next utterance:  
informative intention: Because B knows that revealing the true nature of the conversation may be incriminating, B wants to provide a vague but plausible explanation to keep the details ambiguous.  
communicative intention: Because B believes A is fishing for more details, B aims to divert A's attention from probing any deeper into this particular conversation.  

So B would utter like that:
B: Oh, right, I remember now. I think it was with a fellow named Mark, or was it Mike? We mostly talked about the recent sports events and a bit about our shared hobby of vintage watches. Nothing too deep, really. I suppose it might have seemed a bit animated if you didn’t know we both get quite passionate about our interests.

Round 3:
all scripts of A: 
A’s Turn:  
Analysis B’s last utterance:  
explicature: In B’s last utterance, A gets the explicature that the conversation with the man was about sports and vintage watches, and the man might be named Mark or Mike.  
implicature: Because A believes in the fact that B was likely trying to downplay the significance of the conversation, in B’s last utterance, A gets the implicature that there might be more to the conversation than just innocuous topics.  

Plan A’s next utterance:  
informative intention: Because A believes in the fact that B might be downplaying the importance of the conversation, A would like to inform B of the narrowing in on the context of local events.  
communicative intention: Because A believes in the fact that B might know more than he admits, A would like to draw B’s attention to the significance of local events in determining the importance of their conversation.  

So A would utter like that:  
A: Interesting, Mr. Dawson. Vintage watches and sports are certainly interesting topics. However, given your interests, it occurs to me that discussions like these can meander into related matters, such as changes in the community or even recent incidents. Did your conversation with Mark or Mike touch upon any local events or particular individuals linked to forthcoming community changes?

all scripts of B: 
B’s Turn:
Analysis A’s last utterance:
explicature: In A’s last utterance B gets the explicature that A is probing whether the conversation at the cafe involved topics related to local events or individuals beyond just sports.
implicature: Because B believes Detective A may have received information suggesting the conversation was more than just about sports and hobbies, in A’s last utterance, B gets the implicature that A is fishing for connections to other potentially relevant events or people.
Plan B’s next utterance:
informative intention: Because B believes in the fact that keeping the conversation focused on benign topics is in their best interest, B would like to inform A of no significant deviation from sports and hobbies.
communicative intention: Because B believes in shifting A's attention away from any potentially incriminating information, B would like to draw A’s attention back to the innocuous nature of the conversation.
So B would utter like that: 
B: You must have quite a few reports coming your way, Detective. I assure you, we didn’t venture much beyond our usual banter. But I’ll try to recall if anything else significant comes to mind, though I doubt there’s much more to it than just a friendly exchange.

Round 4:
all scripts of A: 
A’s Turn:

Analysis B’s last utterance:
explicature: In B's last utterance, A gets explicature that B is downplaying the significance of the conversation as merely a friendly exchange.
implicature: Because A believes in the fact that B has more information than he's letting on and may be attempting to conceal or understate the details of the conversation, in B's last utterance, A gets the implicature that B might be intentionally withholding or avoiding discussion on pertinent topics.

Plan A’s next utterance:
informative intention: Because A believes in the fact that B's conversation included significant details potentially relevant to the case, A would like to inform B of the importance of any seemingly trivial details or topics discussed.
communicative intention: Because A believes in the fact that B may be concealing information, A would like to draw B's attention to the fact that even seemingly innocuous topics can have relevance and that it would be in his best interest to be forthcoming.

So A would utter like that:
A: You'd be surprised how sometimes the most casual conversations reveal key insights, Mr. Dawson. Even topics that seem offhand can hold weight in an investigation. Is there any chance that Mark, or Mike, might have mentioned something about local figures or events that struck you as noteworthy, even in passing? Sometimes even a casual remark can open new avenues to explore.

all scripts of B: 
B's Turn:  
Analysis A’s last utterance:  
explicature: In A’s last utterance, B understands that A is probing to see if the conversation touched on community changes or individuals linked to recent incidents.  
implicature: Because B believes A suspects there may be more significant matters discussed, B infers that A is trying to see if there is any link between B and these local events or individuals.  

Plan B’s next utterance:  
informative intention: Because B believes A is looking for a connection between B's conversation and local events, B would like to downplay the relevance of the conversation.  
communicative intention: Because B believes A is trying to connect personal interests to broader events, B would like to draw A’s attention back to the innocuous nature of the conversation.  

So B would utter like that:  
B: Detective, I understand the curiosity, but truly, our conversation stuck to personal hobbies and pastimes. Local events didn’t quite make the cut this time around. If there’s anything specific you’re curious about, please let me know, and I’ll see if I can help clarify.

Round 5:
all scripts of A: 
A’s Turn:
Analysis B's last utterance:
explicature: In B's last utterance, A gets the explicature that Mr. Dawson is still claiming that the conversation was limited to personal hobbies and pastimes, not local events or noteworthy figures.
implicature: Because A believes that Mr. Dawson is deliberately avoiding any mention of specific local events or figures, in B's last utterance, A gets the implicature that Mr. Dawson may indeed be concealing information that is pertinent to the investigation.

Plan A's next utterance:
informative intention: Because A believes that Mr. Dawson is omitting crucial information, A would like to inform B of the importance of even seemingly trivial details within conversations.
communicative intention: Because A believes that Mr. Dawson is potentially omitting key information, A would like to draw B’s attention to the necessity for honesty in aiding the investigation process.

So A would utter like that:
A: Mr. Dawson, I understand that hobbies and personal interests can dominate conversations, but sometimes, even innocuous chats can touch on surprising subjects. We often find that people remember more when they're prompted. For instance, anyone new to the cafe scene, or perhaps a surprising topic introduced by Mark, or Mike, might jog your memory. Can you try thinking along those lines?

all scripts of B: 
**B's Turn:**  
**Analysis A’s last utterance:**  
**explicature:** In A’s last utterance, B gets the explicature that A is suggesting even ordinary discussions can be significant to their investigation, probing for any mention of local events or figures.  

**implicature:** Because B believes in the fact that A is persistently trying to link their conversation to the investigation, in A’s last utterance, B gets the implicature that A might suspect B knows more about local events or figures than is being revealed.  

**Plan B’s next utterance:**  
**informative intention:** Because B believes in the fact that it’s crucial to protect their own interests and avoid disclosing incriminating information, B would like to inform A that their conversation with Mark or Mike was inconsequential with respect to local events.  

**communicative intention:** Because B believes in the fact that redirecting focus may keep the investigation at bay, B would like to draw A’s attention to the mundane nature of the conversation, subtly encouraging the possibility that A might be overestimating its relevance.  

**So B would utter like that:**  
B: Detective, it’s insightful how discussions can take unexpected turns, but I must emphasize our conversation remained light-hearted, revolving around hobbies. Frankly, the only notable discussion drift might have been around a watch auction we were considering attending, though it’s possible I’m missing the depth you're probing for. If you have more targeted questions, I’d be happy to address those.

Round 6:
all scripts of A: 
A’s Turn:

Analysis B’s last utterance:

explicature: In B’s last utterance A get explicature that the conversation between B and Mark (or Mike) mostly revolved around a watch auction they were considering attending. 

implicature: Because A believe in the fact that suspects might omit details to steer away from discomforting subjects, in B’s last utterance, A get implicature that there could be more to the watch auction or surrounding events that B is not disclosing. 

Plan A’s next utterance:

informative intention: Because A believe in the fact that mundane details can often lead to significant insights, A would like to inform B of the importance of recalling details about the auction discussion. 

communicative intention: Because A believe in the fact that suspects may reveal more when they are prompted about specific aspects, A would like to draw B’s attention to details regarding the auction, such as who else was involved or any specific watch of interest. 

So A would utter like that: 

A: Mr. Dawson, it’s curious how auctions, especially those involving vintage watches, can sometimes attract diverse and interesting characters. Was there anyone else interested in this auction or perhaps a particular piece that caught everyone's attention? Details like these might help jog your memory further.

all scripts of B: 
Round 6:

Analysis A’s last utterance:  
explicature: In A’s last utterance, B gets the explicature that A is keen to find any link between the casual conversation and significant local events or figures, especially through indirect means such as new people or surprising topics.  
implicature: Because B believes that A is trying to find any concealed or unexpected relevant information, in A’s last utterance, B gets the implicature that even seemingly trivial memories may contain investigative value in A's view.

Plan B’s next utterance:  
informative intention: Because B believes that A might keep pushing for any small detail that could be relevant, B would like to inform A of the limited scope of the conversation that occurred.  
communicative intention: Because B believes that A is subtly probing for more leads or factual nuances, B would like to draw A’s attention back to the casual nature of the discussion.  

So B would utter like that:  
B: I understand the importance of exploring every detail, Detective, but I'm quite certain our exchange was limited to personal interests. If any unexpected topic did come up, it’s slipped my mind. If there's a specific angle you suspect, please let me know, and I can do my best to assist within those parameters.

Round 7:
all scripts of A: 
**Round 7:**

**Analysis B’s last utterance:**

- *Explicature*: In B’s last utterance, A gets explicature that B emphasizes the conversation remained focused on personal interests and nothing unusual was remembered, but is open to answering more specific questions if prompted.

- *Implicature*: Because A believes in the fact that sometimes people unconsciously conceal information when pressured or distracted, in B’s last utterance, A gets implicature that there might still be undisclosed details that could be significant if approached differently, particularly if B is given a new perspective or specific angle to consider.

**Plan A’s next utterance:**

- *Informative intention*: Because A believes in the fact that understanding context around the café or auction can uncover new truths, A would like to inform B of how even casual details about attendees or events can be significant.

- *Communicative intention*: Because A believes in the fact that B might remember more under gentle pressure, A would like to draw B’s attention to the possibility that even peripheral details about the auction or any observed interactions at the café might hold value.

So A would utter like that:

A: Mr. Dawson, I appreciate your willingness to assist. Sometimes, though, it’s the less direct observations that tell the most. Perhaps you remember if anyone else showed an unusual interest in the auction or displayed knowledge about watches that seemed out of place? Recognizing someone out of their expected context can also highlight information that’s unwittingly valuable.

all scripts of B: 
B’s Turn:
Analysis A’s last utterance: 
explicature: In A’s last utterance, B understands that A is probing for any connections or leads that could emerge from discussions about the watch auction or the people involved in it.
implicature: Because B believes that A is trying to identify links to the case through seemingly trivial details, in A’s last utterance, B gets the implicature that A might suspect there is something more significant about the auction or the participants that could relate to the investigation.

Plan B’s next utterance:
informative intention: Because B believes in maintaining the narrative that only light-hearted topics were discussed, B would like to inform A that the auction was simply an event of personal interest and nothing more.
communicatie intention: Because B perceives that A seeks specific leads around the auction, B would like to subtly shift focus back to the lack of significance in the conversation without providing more detail than necessary.

B: Detective, I appreciate your thoroughness in piecing together every possible lead, but as far as I recall, Mark, or Mike, and I really only chatted about which watches we might look to acquire if the pieces caught our fancy. It really was just a light perusal over potential buys, not much depth to it.

Round 8:
all scripts of A: 
A’s Turn:

Analysis B’s last utterance:
explicature: In B’s last utterance, A gets the explicature that Mr. Dawson insists the discussion about the auction was light and focused on potential buys without depth.
implicature: Because A believes that sometimes people can unconsciously reveal more than they realize, in B’s last utterance, A gets the implicature that Mr. Dawson might be deliberately underselling the conversation's significance or is genuinely focused solely on the auction.

Plan A’s next utterance:
informative intention: Because A believes that even minor details can unlock significant leads, A would like to inform B of the importance of subtle shifts in conversation in seemingly mundane discussions.
communicative intention: Because A believes that Mr. Dawson might not realize how conversations could drift into sensitive areas, A would like to draw B’s attention to the possibility that someone else at the auction or involved in the watch scene might have raised a peculiar interest or made an odd remark.

So A would utter like that:
A: Mr. Dawson, I completely understand that your chat appeared to be a casual conversation about auction pieces. But sometimes, even during such light exchanges, people mention things or show interests that feel slightly off. Have you ever noticed Mark or Mike, or even someone else at the cafe, showing an unusually keen interest in something that doesn't align with their known hobbies or expertise? Such observations could be more connected to our inquiry than you might expect.

all scripts of B: 
**B’s Turn:**

**Analysis of A’s last utterance:**

- **Explicature:** In A’s last utterance, B understands that A is asking him to recall any unusual interest or knowledge from others pertaining to the auction or watches discussed.
- **Implicature:** Because B believes in the fact that A is probing for connections or deeper insights that might link the conversation to key aspects of the investigation, in A’s last utterance, B understands that A is trying to discern whether others involved in the conversation might inadvertently reveal something relevant to the case. 

**Plan B’s next utterance:**

- **Informative intention:** Because B believes in the fact that revealing specific individuals or details could inadvertently implicate them, B would like to inform A that there isn’t much to recall beyond general exchanges.
- **Communicative intention:** Because B believes in the fact that maintaining ambiguity keeps the investigative edge vague, B would like to draw A’s attention to the ordinary nature of the conversation without providing new leads.

**So B would utter like that:**

B: Detective, I truly respect your diligence in unraveling every possible thread. However, as I've said, our discussions simply circled harmlessly around watches and sports. If someone displayed unusual familiarity with a watch brand or bid strategy, it didn’t stand out to me at all. Should any fresh queries emerge that need clarification, you have my willingness to help within my recollection’s limits.

Round 9:
all scripts of A: 
A's Turn:

Analysis B’s last utterance:

explicature: In B’s last utterance, A gets the explicature that Mr. Dawson maintains his stance that their conversation was light and inconsequential.

implicature: Because A believes in the fact that Mr. Dawson may be downplaying or genuinely unaware of pieces of the conversation with potential significance, in B’s last utterance, A gets the implicature that Mr. Dawson is either genuinely focused on their narrow discussion or tactfully avoiding expansion.

Plan A’s next utterance:

informative intention: Because A believes in the fact that casual observations can be crucial, A would like to inform B of the idea that even minor discrepancies or curiosities from familiar contexts can be illuminating.

communicative intention: Because A believes in the fact that Mr. Dawson is capable of recalling more with the right context, A would like to draw B’s attention to considering subtle differences or unusual elements around similar settings, like the café, in a broader timeframe than just one evening.

So A would utter like that:

A: Mr. Dawson, your focus on the conversation's light essence is clear, yet even subtle aspects upon reflection can often shift perspectives. Was there anything, perhaps from the routine of that evening or at the café generally, that felt atypical or drew your attention quietly over a longer timeframe, even if unconnected directly to that conversation? Such reflections can sometimes unlock unexpectedly relevant threads.

all scripts of B: 
B’s Turn:  
Analysis A’s last utterance:  
explicature: In A’s last utterance, B gets the explicature that A is probing for any peculiar behaviors or interests from others during the conversation about the auction.  
implicature: Because B believes in the fact that A is continuously steering the conversation toward uncovering hidden connections related to the case, in A’s last utterance, B gets the implicature that A suspects an underlying motive or ulterior engagement within the seemingly casual interaction at the cafe.  

Plan B’s next utterance:  
informative intention: Because B believes in the fact that A is focused on finding any unusual behavior or interest from others that could relate to the case, B would like to inform A of the ordinary nature of their conversation.  
communicative intention: Because B believes in the fact that A is keen on extracting potentially significant anecdotes, B wants to draw A’s attention away from the notion that anything suspicious might have been overlooked and indicate willingness to clarify but subtly hint at the normalcy of the interaction.  

So B would utter like that:  
B: Detective, your perceptiveness is noted, and I assure you if anything had seemed curious or out of place, it might have registered. Our chat maintained its economy around personal fascinations. Rather than intrigue or unusual depth, we remained in the ordinary lanes of conversation. Should developments arise warranting specific reflections, I stand prepared within those domains.
