To achieve the goal, A have informative intention to highlight potential economic benefits and safeguards within potential agreements, and communicative intention to probe B's appetite for such trade-offs.

7. Utter depend on the A's informative intention and communicative intention:
A's informative intention is to highlight potential economic benefits and safeguards, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is to probe B's appetite for such trade-offs, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:

A: Considering the important balance between economic and environmental priorities, we could look at structuring pilot projects and eventual implementations with specific economic safeguards. This might include economic benefit thresholds before transitioning to full-scale operations. How might your country view an approach where robust environmental commitments accompany economic guarantees?

all scripts of B: 
1. Get explicature from A’s last utterance:  
In A’s last utterance, B gets explicature that A is inquiring about B's specific economic priorities within the potential agreement framework.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that A is inquiring about specific economic priorities, combined with B's believed fact that B's country is interested in maximizing terms that do not hinder economic growth, B can infer implicature that A is probing for B's economic concessions or priorities in structuring agreements. 

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
B gets explicature that A is inquiring about B's specific economic priorities and implicature that A is probing for B's economic concessions, B can conclude the fact that A is trying to discern where B might be flexible on economic issues.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
B's goal is to preserve negotiation leverage by keeping A guessing about their true intentions and the limits of their concessions. The received fact that A is trying to discern where B might be flexible on economic issues contributes to the goal by highlighting areas where B needs to be particularly evasive.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that A is trying to discern B's flexibility, B can refine their new goal to subtly shift the focus back to areas of shared interest without committing to specific economic preferences.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
B's goal is to subtly shift the focus back to areas of shared interest without committing to specific economic preferences. To achieve the goal, B has an informative intention to express interest in mutual economic benefits and a communicative intention to imply the importance of shared frameworks over discrete priorities.

7. Utter depend on the B's informative intention and communicative intention:  
B's informative intention is that mutual economic benefits are of interest, which means information in B's utterance will mainly focus on that. B's communicative intention is to imply the importance of shared frameworks, which means B's utterance will imply A to pay attention to flexible structures rather than specific economic priorities. So B would utter like that:  
B: The flexibility and adaptability of frameworks are indeed crucial, especially in ensuring mutual economic benefits. It would be valuable to explore how these structures can expand over time, supporting both our objectives without narrowing our scope prematurely. How might we collectively explore dynamic expansion possibilities?

Round 8:

A's goal is to discern B's negotiation boundaries to secure a favorable outcome. The received fact that B prefers adaptable approaches and gradual scaling contributes to the goal by highlighting B's preference for flexibility, which can guide A in proposing structures that might be accepted by B.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:
Because of the contribution that B prefers flexibility and gradual commitments, A can refine the new goal to propose specific adaptable frameworks that cater to B's need for flexibility while advancing A's country's priorities.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:
A's goal is to propose specific adaptable frameworks. To achieve the goal, A has informative intention to outline key elements of a flexible framework proposal and communicative intention to emphasize the mutual benefit of such adaptability and growth potential in their shared commitments.

7. Utter depend on the A's informative intention and communicative intention:
A's informative intention is to outline flexible framework elements, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on adaptability. A's communicative intention is to emphasize mutual benefits, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to the potential growth from adaptable commitments. So A would utter like that:

A: It's clear that both flexibility and gradual scaling are essential to our collaboration. We could propose an adaptable framework with an initial pilot phase that sets clear milestones for environmental and economic achievements. This would allow us to periodically reassess and expand based on mutual success, ensuring robust growth without bottlenecking opportunities. How do you feel about this approach as a foundation for our discussions?
