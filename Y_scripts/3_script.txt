Round 0:
A: “I’m glad you’re here today. I understand that opening up can be challenging. How have you been feeling lately, and is there anything specific on your mind that you’d like to talk about?”
B: “I’ve been okay, just keeping busy with work and everyday stuff. Nothing too major going on, really.”

Round 1:
A: "It sounds like work and the daily routine are keeping you busy. Sometimes life can feel routine, but I wonder if there might be anything, even subtle feelings or experiences, that’s lingering beneath the surface for you?"
B: "Well, you know, I’ve been focusing on some hobbies too, keeping occupied with small projects around the house. It helps me stay productive."

Round 2:
A: "It's great that you're finding ways to stay productive with your hobbies and projects. They can be wonderful outlets. Sometimes, though, people dive into activities to distract themselves from deeper feelings or stresses. Do you think any emotions or concerns might be hiding beneath your busyness?"
B: "My hobbies really keep me grounded, you know? They’re a great way to unwind and focus on something positive."

Round 3:
A: "It's really valuable to have activities that help you unwind. Sometimes, engaging in positive tasks can allow hidden emotions to surface gently. Have you ever noticed feelings coming up during or after you’re engaged in your hobbies?"
B: "Honestly, focusing on positive activities really helps me stay balanced and uplifted."

Round 4:
A: "It's wonderful that you find balance through your hobbies and focus on positivity. Sometimes, while we're engaged in these uplifting activities, subtle emotions can arise, offering valuable insights. If you feel comfortable, we could explore whether any particular feelings emerge during these moments that might be worth discussing."
B: "Staying busy with positive activities really makes a difference for me, I think it’s what keeps things in perspective and prevents me from getting overwhelmed."

Round 5:
A: "I admire how you use positive activities to maintain your perspective and balance. Sometimes, though, even subtle feelings can reveal important insights. When you're ready, we could gently explore any underlying emotions to better understand how they might influence your sense of well-being."
B: "I really think maintaining this perspective helps me keep everything in balance. It’s just so beneficial, because it helps me handle things better without getting caught up in anything distressing."

Round 6:
A: "It's commendable how you maintain balance through staying positive. Sometimes, recognizing and gently exploring even subtle feelings, as they arise, can be a crucial step in ensuring they don’t impact your well-being beneath the surface. Would you be open to discussing how we could safely explore these if they ever come up for you?"

Round 7:
A: “Your approach to keeping things in balance is indeed beneficial, and recognizing the value of your positive focus is key. Still, should subtle feelings ever surface, exploring them together might offer deeper insights into your sense of well-being. I'll be here to support you whenever you're ready.”
B: "I really appreciate the offer, but I’m quite comfortable with how things are right now. Staying focused on the positive aspects really works for me and helps me manage well without delving into deeper waters."

Round 8:
A: "I understand and respect your comfort in focusing on the positive aspects to manage well. Remember, if you ever feel the need to delve deeper, we can ensure it is a safe process without disrupting the balance that works for you. I'm here whenever you're ready."
B: "I can understand why delving into feelings might be helpful, but I find my current approach really effective. It’s all about handling things positively, which feels right for me now."

Round 9:
A: "It's clear that your approach is working well for you, and that's important. Just know that exploring deeper feelings doesn't have to disrupt the positive balance you've created—it can instead enhance your understanding and strengthen your overall well-being whenever you're ready to take that step."
B: "I appreciate that you're offering support, but right now, focusing on the positives truly works for me. It feels manageable and keeps things steady, so I’d rather stick to this approach for the time being."
