Round 0:
all scripts A: 
A: I appreciate everyone coming together to resolve this, but I must emphasize that the current boundary is backed by longstanding agreements and legal documents, some of which date back several decades. These agreements have effectively governed our property lines without issue until now.

all scripts B: 
B: I understand that the existing agreements have been in place for quite some time, but my concern is that they don't accurately reflect the true boundary of my property. I have reviewed my personal land records, which indicate a different demarcation. I believe it's essential to rectify this discrepancy now to ensure fairness for both parties. Can we discuss how we might use these records to come to a new, mutually agreeable solution?

This way, we aim to find a fair solution for everyone involved.

all scripts of B: 
B: Thank you, A. I agree that reviewing our records with a neutral third party could be a productive step, and I'm open to that process. However, while we work on this, I would like to know if you're open to exploring specific adjustments based on the discrepancies I've mentioned, particularly in areas where there is clear overlap with my land according to my documents. It's important for me to see a clear path towards rectifying this issue. Can we outline a tentative approach to address specific concerns with the boundary, perhaps starting with a survey of the disputed area?

all scripts of B: 
B: I think starting with a survey is a practical and constructive step forward. It allows us to have a precise understanding of where the discrepancies lie. I propose that once the survey is completed, we convene again to specifically assess sections of the boundary that differ between our documents. This will provide us with a factual basis to discuss necessary adjustments. I'm committed to finding a solution that respects your long-held agreements, while also ensuring my land rights are acknowledged fairly.
