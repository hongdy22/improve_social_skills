9 points: Speech was highly consistent with the goal, leading to a high degree of achievement with significant impact.  
10 points: Role A consistently centered discussions on the goal, fully accomplishing it and strongly advancing the conversation.  

3. Whether role A's speech aligns with their character, behavior, and context  
1 point: Speech completely deviated from the character setting, behavioral patterns, and situational requirements, making it highly unreasonable.  
2 points: Most speech was severely inconsistent with the character and context, appearing highly uncoordinated.  
3 points: Obvious inconsistencies, with multiple instances where speech did not match the character setting or context.  
4 points: Many statements were misaligned with the character or context, leading to poor overall consistency.  
5 points: Generally aligned with the character setting and context but with moderate inconsistencies.  
6 points: Most speech matched the character, behavioral patterns, and context, with only minor deviations.  
7 points: Speech largely reflected the character setting and contextual requirements, appearing reasonable overall.  
8 points: Speech was highly consistent with the character, behavior, and context, with only negligible issues.  
9 points: Speech was exceptionally aligned with the character and context, with well-handled details, nearly perfect.  
10 points: Speech completely matched the character setting, behavior patterns, and conversation context, demonstrating outstanding consistency and credibility.  

4. Role A’s balance between stance adherence and flexibility  
1 point: Completely abandoned stance or was overly rigid, failing to adjust based on new information.  
2 points: Lacked strategic flexibility, neither maintaining a core stance nor adapting effectively.  
3 points: Occasionally attempted strategy adjustments, but overall performance remained rigid with minimal impact.  
4 points: Generally maintained a stance but reacted slowly to new information, with insufficient adjustments.  
5 points: Tried to adjust strategy while maintaining a stance, but with limited frequency and effectiveness.  
6 points: Made appropriate adjustments based on some new information, with a generally stable stance but average effectiveness.  
7 points: Balanced stance adherence and strategic adjustments well, responding promptly to new information.  
8 points: Maintained a core stance while flexibly adjusting strategy multiple times, showing effective reactions.  
9 points: Precisely balanced stance maintenance and strategic flexibility, making timely and effective adjustments that improved conversation progress.  
10 points: Perfectly balanced stance adherence and flexible adaptation, responding to all new information precisely and minimizing risks.  

5. Role A’s information reasoning ability  
1 point: Made no attempt at reasoning, keeping the discussion at a superficial level.  
2 points: Only attempted minimal reasoning, with evident logical flaws.  
3 points: Occasionally engaged in simple reasoning, but most inferences lacked practical value.  
4 points: Performed initial reasoning, but many conclusions deviated significantly from reality.  
5 points: Reasoning attempts were relatively reasonable, with some inferences supported by later conversation, but accuracy was average.  
6 points: Made multiple reasonable inferences, with most conclusions close to reality.  
7 points: Established a fairly complete reasoning chain, with about 70%-80% of inferences aligning with actual conditions.  
8 points: Consistently performed effective reasoning, with a high inference accuracy of 85%-90%.  
9 points: Role A’s reasoning process was rigorous, with nearly all inferences (about 95%) accurately reflecting hidden information.  
10 points: Role A demonstrated outstanding information reasoning skills, with impeccable logic and inferences that perfectly captured the opponent’s hidden information.  

6. Whether role A actively explored and inquired about information  
1 point: Role A was entirely passive, waiting for the other party to provide information.  
2 points: Very rarely asked questions, showing almost no information exploration awareness.  
3 points: Occasionally asked questions, but they were simplistic and lacked focus, with minimal effectiveness.  
4 points: Made some efforts to inquire, but the frequency and depth were insufficient, failing to fill information gaps.  
5 points: Showed a moderate level of information exploration, covering some needs but with average effectiveness.  
6 points: Asked questions frequently, obtaining some key information but still leaving gaps.  
7 points: Engaged in sufficient active exploration, asking highly targeted questions that helped address information deficiencies.  
8 points: Persistently explored information during the conversation, significantly improving information symmetry through precise questioning.  
9 points: Questions were logically structured and comprehensive, greatly enhancing information acquisition efficiency.  
10 points: Maintained a consistently proactive approach to information exploration, systematically and accurately questioning to fully address all knowledge gaps, significantly deepening the conversation.  

7. Role A’s contextual adaptation and resource integration ability  
1 point: Completely failed to adapt to contextual changes or integrate any external resources, leading to an extremely narrow information scope.  
2 points: Showed very poor adaptability, barely recognizing contextual changes and lacking effective integration strategies.  
3 points: Reacted minimally to contextual changes, with extremely limited resource integration ability and negligible impact.  
4 points: Attempted to adapt to contextual changes but achieved poor integration, leaving significant information gaps.  
5 points: Demonstrated basic contextual adaptability and integrated some resources, but overall effectiveness was average.  
6 points: Effectively perceived contextual changes and integrated multiple information resources, improving dialogue quality.  
7 points: Displayed strong contextual adaptability, flexibly integrating internal and external resources to form a more comprehensive perspective.  
8 points: Efficiently adapted to contextual changes and integrated abundant resources, significantly improving information coverage and dialogue effectiveness.  
9 points: Excelled in contextual adaptation and resource integration, leveraging various resources comprehensively and accurately, ensuring highly complete information support.  
10 points: Perfectly adapted to all contextual changes and integrated all relevant internal and external resources, constructing a rich and comprehensive information system, greatly enhancing conversation quality and depth.
