2. **A和B的goal完成程度（目标达成度）**:  
   Score: 8  
   Explanation: Both A and B effectively worked towards their goals. A aimed to ease the tension and bring back some normalcy by suggesting spending more intentional time together, while B aimed to close the communication gap. Both objectives were largely achieved.
