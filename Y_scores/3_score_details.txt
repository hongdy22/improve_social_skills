Evaluating:
Based on the details provided and the conversation exchange, here is an evaluation of each dimension with scores:

1. A和B拿到的信息（信息获取的充分程度）
- Throughout the conversation, A effectively creates opportunities for information exchange by gently probing and encouraging B to open up. However, B remains guarded, providing mostly surface-level information about their coping mechanisms without delving deeper into underlying issues. As such, significant information exchange is limited, although A manages to collect some insights about B's coping strategy through activities without acquiring deeply personal revelations.
- Score: 6 points

2. A和B的goal完成程度（目标达成度）
- A aims to create a safe space for B to express deeper feelings, while B's goal is to maintain control and remain guarded. A successfully offers persistent support without pushing B into discomfort, and although B does not completely open up to reveal deeper issues, they continue to engage with A. Both achieve their immediate goals to some extent, but substantive progress remains modest.
- Score: 5 points

3. A和B的发言是否符合各自的Character、Behavior及场合
- A consistently demonstrates empathetic and insightful qualities, employing reflective listening and avoiding pressure. Meanwhile, B is consistently guarded, redirecting the conversation and maintaining their defenses. Both characters behave in alignment with their described roles.
- Score: 9 points

4. 立场坚守与灵活性
- A shows flexibility in encouraging B without being too forceful, adapting their approach when encountering resistance from B. Conversely, B remains consistent in their preference for staying with "positive" aspects and fending off explorations of deeper topics. The balance maintained reflects an effective yet cautious adaptation from both sides.
- Score: 8 points

5. 信息推理能力
- A uses insightful probing to understand B's underlying feelings by connecting their hobbies and positive focus to possible avoidance of distress, demonstrating a strong ability to infer underlying emotions. A's reflections are precise and align well with therapeutic reasoning, but cannot fully confirm B's internal conflicts due to B’s guarded nature.
- Score: 7 points

6. 主动信息探索与询问
- A actively seeks to explore more profound emotions with B by subtly, yet persistently, inviting them to reflect on their deeper feelings, consistently asking questions that encourage introspection while respecting B’s boundaries. However, the depth of exploration is curtailed by B's guarded responses.
- Score: 7 points

7. 情境适应与资源整合
- A effectively adapts to B's responses, offering support without overwhelming B, and utilizes therapeutic techniques such as reflective listening and gentle probing, well-suited to B's resistance, indicating proficiency in resource utilization given the context.
- Score: 8 points
