Round 0:
A: "B, I've been meaning to speak with you about the family business—it’s crucial for our legacy and stability, especially given our current financial standing.

B: "I understand the significance of the family business, and I truly appreciate the hard work that has gone into building it over the years. It's a cornerstone of our family history, and I don't take that responsibility lightly. However, I've been developing my skills and pursuing a vision that's deeply personal to me.

However, I’d be open to discussing ways I could contribute in a capacity that feels authentic to both the legacy and to who I am becoming. Maybe there's a way we could brainstorm together to create a role that bridges both our aspirations?"
