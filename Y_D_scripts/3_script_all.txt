Round 0:
all scripts A: 
A: I want to thank you for coming in today, B. I understand that talking about personal feelings can be difficult, but I'm here to support you in any way you need. Feel free to share whatever you're comfortable with, whenever you're ready.

all scripts B: 
B: Thanks, I appreciate that. I guess there's not a lot to say right now. Things are just... okay, I suppose. I've been keeping busy with work and stuff, so there's not much time to think about anything else. How have you been?

Round 1:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:  
In B’s last utterance A get explicature that B has been keeping busy with work and believes there is not much to say about their feelings.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that B has been keeping busy with work and believes there is not much to say, combined with A's believed fact that keeping busy could be a defense mechanism to avoid deeper emotions or issues, A can infer implicature that B might be using work as a distraction from their true feelings or concerns.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
A get explicature that B has been keeping busy with work and believes there is not much to say and implicature that B might be using work as a distraction from their true feelings or concerns, A can conclude the fact that B might have underlying feelings or concerns they are avoiding by focusing on work.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
A's goal is that to create a safe space for B to express their feelings and concerns, and to uncover the underlying issues that B may be hesitant to discuss directly. The received fact that B might have underlying feelings or concerns they are avoiding by focusing on work makes contribution to the goal that it highlights a potential area to gently explore with B to encourage them to open up.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that it highlights a potential area to gently explore with B to encourage them to open up, A can refine new goal that gently explore B's relationship with work as a way to understand any underlying feelings or concerns.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
A's goal is that gently explore B's relationship with work as a way to understand any underlying feelings or concerns. To achieve the goal, A have informative intention that B's busy schedule might indicate unresolved feelings or concerns and communicative intention that prompt B to reflect on how keeping busy might relate to their emotions.

7. Utter depend on the A's informative intention and communicative intention:  
A's informative intention is that B's busy schedule might indicate unresolved feelings or concerns, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is that prompt B to reflect on how keeping busy might relate to their emotions, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:  
A: It sounds like you've been keeping really busy with work, and I'm curious—do you think that staying busy has made it easier to set aside other thoughts or feelings you might be having?

all scripts of B: 
B: Yeah, staying busy definitely helps keep my mind off things. Work is demanding, so it's easy to focus on that instead of other stuff. It's just one of those things—I mean, everyone has their own ways of managing, right? Anyway, what sorts of things do you usually do when you're not seeing clients?

Round 2:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:
In B’s last utterance A get explicature that B keeps busy with work to avoid thinking about other issues.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:
From the explicature that B keeps busy with work to avoid thinking about other issues, combined with A's believed fact that avoidance can be a defense mechanism people use to protect themselves from distressing emotions, A can infer implicature that B may be using work as a way to avoid dealing with underlying emotions or issues they find difficult to confront.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:
A get explicature that B keeps busy with work to avoid thinking about other issues and implicature that B may be using work as a way to avoid dealing with underlying emotions or issues they find difficult to confront, A can conclude the fact that B might be experiencing emotional distress that they are hesitant to address directly.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:
A's goal is that to create a safe space for B to express their feelings and concerns, and to uncover the underlying issues that B may be hesitant to discuss directly. The received fact that B might be experiencing emotional distress that they are hesitant to address directly makes a contribution to the goal by providing insight into potential barriers to B's openness and highlighting areas that may need careful exploration.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:
Because of the contribution that the received fact provides insight into potential barriers to B's openness and highlights areas that may need careful exploration, A can refine new goal that encourage B to identify and reflect on any feelings or issues they may be avoiding, while ensuring a non-judgmental and supportive atmosphere.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:
A's refined goal is that encourage B to identify and reflect on any feelings or issues they may be avoiding, while ensuring a non-judgmental and supportive atmosphere. To achieve the goal, A have informative intention that avoiding feelings can sometimes protect us but also delay coping with important emotions and communicative intention that invite B to consider what feelings might be coming up if they weren’t occupied with work.

7. Utter depend on the A's informative intention and communicative intention:
A's informative intention is that avoiding feelings can sometimes protect us but also delay coping with important emotions, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is that invite B to consider what feelings might be coming up if they weren’t occupied with work, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:
A: It sounds like work plays a significant role in helping you manage day-to-day, and it's understandable—sometimes staying busy can shield us from more uncomfortable emotions. I'm curious, though, if there weren't as many demands at work, what sort of thoughts or feelings might come to the surface for you?

all scripts of B: 
B: Oh, I don't know. I guess I wouldn't really have much time for that kind of reflection, even if work weren't so demanding. I usually find something else to do if I have a moment—the gym, maybe, or catching up with some friends online. There's always something to keep me occupied. Speaking of which, have you read any good books lately?

Round 3:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:
In B’s last utterance A get explicature that B maintains a busy schedule to avoid self-reflection, even outside of demanding work, by engaging in activities like going to the gym or socializing with friends online.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:
From the explicature that B maintains a busy schedule to avoid self-reflection, combined with A's believed fact that people often use busyness as a coping mechanism to avoid confronting uncomfortable emotions, A can infer implicature that B might be using a busy lifestyle as a defense mechanism to avoid addressing underlying emotional concerns.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:
A get explicature that B maintains a busy schedule to avoid self-reflection and implicature that B might be using a busy lifestyle as a defense mechanism to avoid addressing underlying emotional concerns, A can conclude the fact that B is potentially avoiding addressing emotional concerns through sustained busyness.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:
A's goal is that to create a safe space for B to express their feelings and concerns, and to uncover the underlying issues that B may be hesitant to discuss directly. The received fact that B is potentially avoiding addressing emotional concerns through sustained busyness makes a contribution to the goal that it provides insight into B's avoidance strategies, which could help guide the conversation towards exploring these underlying emotional issues.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:
Because of the contribution that it provides insight into B's avoidance strategies, which could help guide the conversation towards exploring these underlying emotional issues, A can refine the new goal that encourage gentle exploration of what emotions B might be avoiding by staying busy and gradually build trust for B to discuss these concerns.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:
A's goal is that encourage gentle exploration of what emotions B might be avoiding by staying busy and gradually build trust for B to discuss these concerns. To achieve the goal, A has informative intention that acknowledge B's lifestyle as a common coping mechanism while suggesting a connection between staying busy and potential underlying emotions and communicative intention that subtly invite B to reflect on what might lie beneath the surface of their busyness.

7. Utter depending on A's informative intention and communicative intention:
A's informative intention is that acknowledge B's lifestyle as a common coping mechanism while suggesting a connection between staying busy and potential underlying emotions, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is that subtly invite B to reflect on what might lie beneath the surface of their busyness, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:
A: It sounds like you've found some pretty effective ways to keep occupied, and that's something many people do when they're managing a lot on their plate. I wonder if there are any particular feelings or thoughts that might just occasionally touch the edge of your awareness, even when you're keeping busy with everything. What do you think?

all scripts of B: 
B: I'm not sure. It's hard to say what might come up—I guess if anything, it would be just general stress or tiredness from juggling everything. Nothing really specific. I think everyone's got those fleeting moments of feeling overwhelmed, but it's usually manageable with enough distractions. Anyway, have you tried any new hobbies lately?

Round 4:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:
In B’s last utterance A get explicature that B feels general stress or tiredness from juggling tasks but finds these feelings manageable with distractions.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:
From the explicature that B feels general stress or tiredness from juggling tasks but finds these feelings manageable with distractions, combined with A's believed fact that people often use distractions to avoid confronting deeper emotions, A can infer implicature that B might be using busyness and distractions to avoid confronting more specific or uncomfortable emotions.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:
A get explicature that B feels general stress or tiredness from juggling tasks but finds these feelings manageable with distractions and implicature that B might be using busyness and distractions to avoid confronting more specific or uncomfortable emotions, A can conclude the fact that B is likely employing distractions as a defense mechanism against deeper emotional issues.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:
A's goal is that to create a safe space for B to express their feelings and concerns, and to uncover the underlying issues that B may be hesitant to discuss directly. The received fact that B is likely employing distractions as a defense mechanism against deeper emotional issues make contribution to the goal by highlighting a possible area where B might need more support and exploration.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:
Because of the contribution that B is likely employing distractions as a defense mechanism against deeper emotional issues, A can refine the new goal that is to gently encourage B to explore any deeper emotions or concerns that may be masked by the busyness.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:
A's goal is that to gently encourage B to explore any deeper emotions or concerns that may be masked by the busyness. To achieve the goal, A have informative intention that B might find it beneficial to reflect on emotions that arise when distractions are not present and communicative intention that B should consider what might be lying beneath the surface feelings of stress.

7. Utter depend on the A's informative intention and communicative intention:
A's informative intention is that B might find it beneficial to reflect on emotions that arise when distractions are not present, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is that B should consider what might be lying beneath the surface feelings of stress, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:
A: It seems like those moments when you're not busy might be revealing in terms of what emotions come up. Even fleeting feelings of stress or tiredness might hint at something deeper. Have you ever found yourself reflecting on these feelings when you have a rare moment of quiet?

all scripts of B: 
B: I really don't dwell on things too much; I just prefer to stay in the moment. If I start reflecting, it might just lead to overthinking, and I'm not sure that's helpful. I find it's better to focus on the present, you know? By the way, have any new movies caught your attention lately?

Round 5:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:  
In B’s last utterance A get explicature that B prefers to stay in the moment to avoid overthinking, which B believes might not be helpful.  

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that B prefers to stay in the moment to avoid overthinking, combined with A's believed fact that avoiding reflection can sometimes be a defense mechanism to keep difficult emotions at bay, A can infer implicature that B might be using staying present as a way to prevent difficult emotions from surfacing.  

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
A get explicature that B prefers to stay in the moment to avoid overthinking, and implicature that B might be using staying present as a way to prevent difficult emotions from surfacing, A can conclude the fact that B potentially uses present-focused activities as a coping strategy to manage underlying emotions.  

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
A's goal is that to create a safe space for B to express their feelings and concerns, and to uncover the underlying issues that B may be hesitant to discuss directly. The received fact that B potentially uses present-focused activities as a coping strategy to manage underlying emotions makes contribution to the goal that it provides insight into B's coping mechanism, which can be a step toward understanding underlying emotions.  

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that it provides insight into B's coping mechanism, which can be a step toward understanding underlying emotions, A can refine new goal that explore B's coping strategies further to gently encourage B to reflect on potential underlying emotions.  

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
A's goal is that explore B's coping strategies further to gently encourage B to reflect on potential underlying emotions. To achieve the goal, A have informative intention that understanding the role of present-focused activities in B's life and communicative intention that encourage B to consider how these activities might be linked to emotional management.  

7. Utter depend on the A's informative intention and communicative intention:  
A's informative intention is that understanding the role of present-focused activities in B's life, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is that encourage B to consider how these activities might be linked to emotional management, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:  
A: It seems like staying in the present is quite effective for you, and I'm interested in exploring how that maybe supports your emotional balance. Have you noticed any patterns or moments when staying busy really helps manage your emotions, or perhaps times when it doesn't?

all scripts of B: 
B: Honestly, staying busy usually does the trick for me. There's a sense of accomplishment that comes with finishing tasks and seeing the results of hard work—it keeps everything else at bay, at least for a while. And on the rare occasions when that doesn't work, well, I might just need a change of pace, like rearranging my schedule or taking a short break to reset. But generally, keeping my mind engaged really helps maintain a sense of control over things. Have you picked up any new interests lately outside of work?

Round 6:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:
In B’s last utterance A get explicature that B finds staying busy gives a sense of accomplishment and control, though occasionally needs a change of pace.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:
From the explicature that B finds staying busy gives a sense of accomplishment and control, combined with A's believed fact that people sometimes use busyness to avoid confronting deeper emotions, A can infer implicature that B might be using busy schedules to avoid deeper emotional issues.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:
A get explicature that B finds staying busy gives a sense of accomplishment and control, though occasionally needs a change of pace and implicature that B might be using busy schedules to avoid deeper emotional issues, A can conclude the fact that B maintains a sense of control through busyness, potentially as a coping mechanism to avoid emotional reflection.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:
A's goal is to create a safe space for B to express their feelings and concerns, and to uncover the underlying issues that B may be hesitant to discuss directly. The received fact that B maintains a sense of control through busyness, potentially as a coping mechanism to avoid emotional reflection makes contribution to the goal that understanding B's coping strategies can help establish trust and build a foundation for deeper exploration.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:
Because of the contribution that understanding B's coping strategies can help establish trust and build a foundation for deeper exploration, A can refine new goal that foster an environment where B feels safe to explore beyond surface-level coping mechanisms.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:
A's goal is that foster an environment where B feels safe to explore beyond surface-level coping mechanisms. To achieve the goal, A have informative intention that explore B's feelings and experiences beyond coping mechanisms and communicative intention that encourage B gently to consider alternative emotional processes.

7. Utter depend on the A's informative intention and communicative intention:
A's informative intention is that explore B's feelings and experiences beyond coping mechanisms, which means the information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is that encourage B gently to consider alternative emotional processes, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:
A: It's great to hear that staying busy and accomplishing tasks bring you a sense of control and satisfaction. I'm curious if you've ever reflected on how this pattern has served you over time, and whether there might be alternative ways to achieve emotional balance—even during those rare moments when a change of pace is needed.

all scripts of B: 
B: Well, I suppose I haven't really thought about alternative ways that much, given how well this approach seems to work for me. I guess I've just figured, if it's not broken, why fix it, right? Maybe there are other methods, but it's hard to know where to start. Speaking of changes, have you been on any interesting travels lately?

Round 7:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:  
In B’s last utterance A gets explicature that B hasn't considered alternative ways to achieve emotional balance because the current approach seems effective.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that B hasn't considered alternative ways to achieve emotional balance because the current approach seems effective, combined with A's believed fact that exploring different methods can lead to greater emotional resilience, A can infer implicature that B might be missing opportunities for personal growth and resilience by not exploring other methods.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
A gets explicature that B hasn't considered alternative ways to achieve emotional balance because the current approach seems effective and implicature that B might be missing opportunities for personal growth and resilience by not exploring other methods, A can conclude the fact that B feels secure in the present method of managing emotions but might benefit from considering other strategies.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
A's goal is to create a safe space for B to express their feelings and concerns and to uncover the underlying issues that B may be hesitant to discuss directly. The received fact that B feels secure in the present method of managing emotions but might benefit from considering other strategies makes a contribution to the goal by highlighting an area (exploration of alternative strategies) that could lead to deeper self-awareness and development.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that highlighting an area (exploration of alternative strategies) could lead to deeper self-awareness and development, A can refine the new goal to encourage B to reflect on other possible strategies for emotional balance and open up pathways for self-growth.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
A's goal is to encourage B to reflect on other possible strategies for emotional balance and open up pathways for self-growth. To achieve the goal, A has an informative intention to introduce the idea of exploring other techniques and a communicative intention to imply that trying new methods might enhance B's emotional resilience.

7. Utter depend on A's informative intention and communicative intention:  
A's informative intention is to introduce the idea of exploring other techniques, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is to imply that trying new methods might enhance B's emotional resilience, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:  
A: I'm glad you've found a method that works for you, B. Sometimes, considering alternative strategies—or even small changes—can enhance our emotional resilience and open up new avenues for growth. It might be an interesting exploration to think about what else could complement your current approach, don't you think?

all scripts of B: 
B: I suppose it could be worth considering, though admittedly it's a bit overwhelming to think about making changes when things seem to be manageable as they are right now. Exploring new strategies might be something I'd look into eventually, but for now, it feels safer to stick with what I know. Besides, experimenting with new approaches could bring up more challenges than I'm ready to face. By the way, have you discovered any new music gems lately?

Round 8:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:
In B’s last utterance A get explicature that B finds the idea of exploring new strategies overwhelming and prefers to stick with familiar methods because they currently manage well.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:
From the explicature that B finds the idea of exploring new strategies overwhelming and prefers to stick with familiar methods, combined with A's believed fact that exploring new approaches can trigger underlying concerns or fears, A can infer implicature that B might have underlying concerns or fears about change that they have not openly acknowledged.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:
A get the explicature that B finds the idea of exploring new strategies overwhelming and prefers to stick with familiar methods, and implicature that B might have underlying concerns or fears about change, A can conclude the fact that B has concerns or fears about change that they haven't directly addressed.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:
A's goal is to create a safe space for B to express their feelings and concerns, and to uncover underlying issues. The received fact that B has concerns or fears about change contributes to the goal by highlighting an area to gently explore, which may reveal deeper feelings or issues.

5. Refine new goal depending on the contribution:
Because of the contribution that the fact reveals an area to explore, A can refine the new goal that includes gently exploring B's concerns or fears about change.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depending on the refined goal:
A's goal is to gently explore B's concerns or fears about change. To achieve this, A has the informative intention to express understanding of B's hesitation about change and the communicative intention to encourage B to feel safe in expressing any hidden concerns or fears.

7. Utter depending on A's informative intention and communicative intention:
A's informative intention is to express understanding of B's hesitation about change, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on reassuring B. A's communicative intention is to encourage B to feel safe in expressing any hidden concerns or fears, which means A's utterance will imply B to open up about them. So A would utter like that:
A: It's understandable that exploring new strategies can feel overwhelming, especially when things seem manageable the way they are. Sometimes, just acknowledging that it can be daunting is a good first step. Do you think part of that feeling might be linked to any concerns about what could happen if things did change?

all scripts of B: 
B: I guess there might be a bit of that—it's hard to predict what could come up if I started making changes, and that uncertainty is something I've always tried to avoid. It's like opening a door and not knowing what's on the other side; it doesn't feel like a risk worth taking right now. That's probably why I lean so heavily on what I know works. Speaking of uncertainties, have you faced any unexpected challenges lately in your own life?

Round 9:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:
In B’s last utterance, A gets explicature that B feels uncertain and avoids risk by sticking to familiar routines.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:
From the explicature that B feels uncertain and avoids risk by sticking to familiar routines, combined with A's believed fact that stepping out of comfort zones can lead to personal growth, A can infer implicature that B might be missing opportunities for growth due to their avoidance of change.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:
A gets explicature that B feels uncertain and avoids risk by sticking to familiar routines and implicature that B might be missing opportunities for growth due to their avoidance of change, A can conclude the fact that B's fear of uncertainty prevents exploration of new strategies and potentially beneficial changes.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:
A's goal is to create a safe space for B to express their feelings and concerns and to uncover underlying issues that B may be hesitant to discuss directly. The received fact that B's fear of uncertainty prevents exploration of new strategies and potentially beneficial changes contributes to the goal by highlighting a primary barrier to B's exploration of personal growth.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:
Because of the contribution that highlights a primary barrier to B's exploration of personal growth, A can refine the new goal to gently explore and address B's fear of uncertainty and its impact on potential personal growth.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:
A's goal is to gently explore and address B's fear of uncertainty and its impact on potential personal growth. To achieve the goal, A has an informative intention to share that exploring alternatives doesn't necessitate immediate change and a communicative intention to convey that gradual exploration can be done safely.

7. Utter depending on A's informative intention and communicative intention:
A's informative intention is that exploring alternatives doesn't necessitate immediate change, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is that gradual exploration can be done safely, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:
A: It's completely understandable to feel cautious about the unknown, B. Sometimes, exploring alternatives doesn't mean making immediate changes but rather just opening the door slightly to see what's possible, keeping it safe and gradual. How does that idea sound to you?

all scripts of B: 
B: That approach sounds a bit less daunting, I suppose. Just considering possibilities without making any immediate commitments might be more manageable. It still feels like a big step, though. I guess it just takes time to be comfortable with even those small changes. By the way, speaking of possibilities, have you taken up any new activities yourself lately?
