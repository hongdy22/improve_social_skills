Round 0:
all scripts A: 
A: Good afternoon, I appreciate you coming down to speak with us voluntarily. There are just a few details we need to clarify to get a better understanding of where things stand. For instance, could you walk me through your whereabouts on the night of the 15th? It's important we get every detail right.

all scripts B: 
B: Good afternoon, Detective. I'm more than willing to help however I can. As for the night of the 15th, I was mostly at home, catching up on some personal work. I did step out briefly to grab some groceries at that little store around the corner. It's quite charming, and their selection is just what I needed to clear my mind. I'm curious though—what exactly happened that night that you need to piece together?

Round 1:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:
In B’s last utterance, A gets the explicature that B claims to have been at home mostly on the night of the 15th, but they stepped out briefly to grab groceries at a nearby store.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:
From the explicature that B was mostly at home but stepped out briefly, combined with A's believed fact that there were reports of unusual activity around that corner store on the night of the 15th, A can infer the implicature that B might have had an opportunity to be involved in or witness the unusual activity.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:
A gets explicature that B was at the store briefly on the night of the 15th and implicature that B might have had an opportunity related to the unusual activity. A can conclude the fact that B's whereabouts potentially place them at the scene of interest.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation. The received fact that B's whereabouts potentially place them at the scene of interest makes a contribution to the goal by aligning B's presence with a relevant location, which may help verify or challenge other evidence.

5. Refine new goal depending on the contribution:
Because of the contribution that B's presence at the location aligns with a relevant event, A can refine the new goal to probe further into B's activities and observations around the time they were at the store to gather more precise information about their involvement or insights.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:
A's goal is to probe further into B's activities and observations around the store visit. To achieve the goal, A has the informative intention to elicit more specific details about B's visit to the store and the communicative intention to prompt B to focus on the timing and any unusual sights or interactions.

7. Utter depending on A's informative intention and communicative intention:
A's informative intention is to elicit more specific details about B's visit to the store, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is to prompt B to pay attention to the timing and any unusual sights or interactions, which means A's utterance will imply B to think about those aspects. So A would utter like this:
A: I'm curious about your grocery trip. Do you recall around what time you went to the store, and if there was anything unusual you noticed or encountered on your way there or back? Anything out of the ordinary could be helpful.

all scripts of B: 
B: Oh, let me think... I suppose it was around 9 PM when I decided to head out. The night felt quite normal, really; nothing seemed amiss on my walk. The street was relatively quiet, as it usually is at that time. Though I must say, the store was unusually busy, but I guess that's to be expected with a new shipment. Isn't it fascinating how people are drawn to fresh arrivals? Anyway, did something happen nearby that has you curious about my evening stroll?

Round 2:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:
In B’s last utterance A get explicature that B went to the store around 9 PM, noticed nothing amiss on the way except the store being unusually busy due to a new shipment.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:
From the explicature that B went to the store around 9 PM and noticed nothing unusual except busyness, combined with A's believed fact that there was an incident occurring nearby around the same time, A can infer implicature that B might be downplaying or overlooking any disturbances witnessed due to the focus on the store's busyness.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:
A get explicature that B went to the store around 9 PM and the store was busy, and implicature that B may be overlooking disturbances, A can conclude the fact that B's account of the evening is typical except for the focus on the store's busyness, potentially missing noteworthy details about the surroundings.

4. Evaluate the contrbution of the received fact to the goal:
A's goal is that to uncover the truth behind the suspect’s statements without compromising the investigation's integrity. The received fact that B's account is typical but potentially missing important surroundings details contributes by indicating potential oversight or intentional omission of details by B.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contrbution:
Because of the contrbution that B might be overlooking or omitting relevant details, A can refine the new goal to extract more specific observations from B about the surroundings, potentially revealing overlooked incidents.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:
A's goal is that to extract more specific observations from B about the surroundings, potentially revealing overlooked incidents. To achieve the goal, A has informative intention that to guide B to focus on external details during the grocery trip and communicative intention that to imply B to reconsider the evening's external happenings carefully.

7. Utter depend on the A's informative intention and communicative intention:
A's informative intention is that to guide B to focus on external details during the grocery trip, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is that to imply B to reconsider the evening's external happenings carefully, which means A's utterance will prompt B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:
A: You mentioned the store being unusually busy due to a shipment, and it caught your attention. It's intriguing how certain aspects stand out on such walks. When reflecting on the evening, might there be any additional sounds, sightings, or activities around the neighborhood that seemed out of place, however subtle they might be? These could be more significant than they appear.

all scripts of B: 
B: As I think back, Detective, I honestly can't say there were any unusual sounds or activities that caught my attention. The neighborhood has always had a sense of tranquility, especially at that hour. Perhaps the gentle hum of distant traffic or the occasional bark of a dog were what one might expect. But since you mentioned subtlety, it does make me wonder about the possibility of something slipping under my radar. It's interesting, isn't it, how easily overlooked the mundane can be? Were there perhaps incidents elsewhere that might have a bearing on this seemingly uneventful evening?

Round 3:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:  
In B’s last utterance A get explicature that B doesn't recall any unusual sounds or activities during their walk and emphasizes the tranquility of the neighborhood at that hour.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that B doesn't recall any unusual sounds or activities during their walk, combined with A's believed fact that a significant noise disruption occurred in the neighborhood that night, A can infer implicature that B might be deliberately withholding information or might not be as observant as claimed.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
A get explicature that B doesn't recall any unusual sounds or activities during their walk and implicature that B might be deliberately withholding information or might not be as observant as claimed, A can conclude the fact that B’s testimony may be unreliable or incomplete regarding the events of that night.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation's integrity or revealing its current status. The received fact that B’s testimony may be unreliable or incomplete contributes to the goal by indicating a potential area of deception or lack of attention to detail in B’s account, which may guide further questioning.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that indicates a potential area of deception or lack of attention to detail in B’s account, A can refine the new goal to focus on identifying specific inconsistencies or overlooked details in B's testimony that contrast with other known evidence.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
A's goal is to focus on identifying specific inconsistencies or overlooked details in B's testimony. To achieve this goal, A has the informative intention to provide areas of interest where B's observation might fail, and the communicative intention to subtly pressure B to reconsider aspects of their account.

7. Utter depend on the A's informative intention and communicative intention:  
A's informative intention is to provide areas of interest where B's observation might fail, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is to subtly pressure B to reconsider aspects of their account, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:  
A: It's interesting how tranquility can sometimes mask unusual activity. I find it curious that a neighborhood with such a claim to calm had reports of disturbances that night, yet you didn't notice anything. Are there any routes or parts of your walk where you might feel overly familiar, leading you to overlook certain details?

all scripts of B: 
B: Detective, I suppose it's possible that familiarity breeds a certain degree of inattentiveness. My usual route to the store tends to be quite routine, so perhaps I was lost in thought more than I realized. I've traversed those streets countless times, and I tend to focus on getting to the store and back efficiently. If there were disturbances, they might not have registered with me unless they were blatantly obvious. However, it's strange that such reports would surface—this area is not typically prone to unrest. Could it be that these so-called disturbances were perhaps exaggerated or misreported? It’s always tricky knowing the full scope of such accounts without multiple firsthand perspectives.

Round 4:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:  
In B’s last utterance, A gets explicature that B acknowledges the possibility that familiarity led to inattentiveness on their usual route to the store and questions the veracity of reported disturbances.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that B acknowledges inattentiveness and questions disturbance reports, combined with A's believed fact that there were genuine disturbances reported by credible witnesses, A can infer implicature that B might be attempting to cast doubt on genuine events or distance themselves from them due to a lack of awareness.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
A gets explicature that B acknowledges inattentiveness and questions disturbance reports and implicature that B might be casting doubt on events or distancing themselves, A can conclude the fact that B admits to a lack of full awareness during their trip due to routine familiarity.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation's integrity. The received fact that B admits to a lack of full awareness contributes to the goal by providing a plausible reason for B not noticing disturbances, which might suggest B's testimony could contain unintentional gaps.

5. Refine new goal dependent on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that B's testimony might contain unintentional gaps, A can refine the new goal to determine specific points in B's routine where they might have overlooked critical details.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention dependent on the refined goal:  
A's goal is to determine specific points in B's routine where they might have overlooked critical details. To achieve the goal, A has informative intention to explore B’s routine for points of distraction or inattention and communicative intention to encourage B to reflect more critically on the typical journey's potential hidden aspects.

7. Utter depending on A's informative intention and communicative intention:  
A's informative intention is to explore B's routine for points of distraction or inattention, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is to encourage B to reflect more critically on the typical journey's potential hidden aspects, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:  
A: Given your familiarity with the route, it could be beneficial to reconsider moments of possible distraction during your walk to the store. Was there anything in particular along your path that might typically draw your attention or cause you to pause, even briefly, that could have hidden something significant?

all scripts of B: 
B: Detective, now that you mention it, there might have been a quick pause at the florist's near the store, as their window displays often catch my eye with their vibrant arrangements. I suppose I might stop for a brief moment to admire them, but it's really more of a habitual pause than anything substantial. The colors are a nice distraction from the routine. However, I can't say there was anything particularly different about it that evening. It's just one of those things that brightens the walk. How crucial is it for you to explore this angle? Could the possibility of an oversight at that spot really change the narrative of the night?

Round 5:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:  
In B’s last utterance, A gets explicature that B habitually pauses at the florist's to admire the window displays, but recalls nothing particularly different about that evening.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that B habitually pauses at the florist's, combined with A's believed fact that disturbances were reported nearby, A can infer implicature that B might have been distracted during a potentially significant moment.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
A gets explicature that B habitually pauses at the florist's window and implicature that B might have been distracted during a significant moment. A can conclude the fact that B's attention was likely diverted during the walk, possibly affecting their perception of the evening's events.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation's integrity. The received fact that B's attention was likely diverted make contribution to the goal that it provides a possible reason for B's lack of awareness of disturbances.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that it provides a possible reason for B's lack of awareness of disturbances, A can refine new goal that is to gently probe for more details regarding the exact time and other distractions around the florist shop.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
A's goal is to gently probe for more details regarding the exact time and other distractions around the florist shop. To achieve this goal, A has informative intention to get more specifics about that pause and communicative intention to emphasize the importance of every small detail during the encounter.

7. Utter depend on A's informative intention and communicative intention:  
A's informative intention is to get more specifics about that pause, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is to emphasize the importance of every small detail during the encounter, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:  
A: It's often the little things that can make the biggest difference in understanding a situation. When you paused at the florist's window, did you happen to notice anyone else nearby, or perhaps sense anything unusual about the surroundings, even if it seemed mundane at the time? The slightest detail might be more revealing than it first appears.

all scripts of B: 
B: Detective, I must admit that during my brief pause at the florist's, I was mostly focused on the vibrant window display. It's one of those comforting rituals that provide a momentary escape from the mundane. As for noticing others, there might have been a couple of passersby, but nothing really stood out enough to leave an impression. The street seemed calm, with perhaps an occasional silhouette passing by. The usual sounds of the breeze rustling through leaves accompanied by faint conversations from the distance were present. It's intriguing how our minds selectively remember certain details while others slip by unnoticed, isn't it? Do you think revisiting these subtle nuances could substantially affect our understanding of what truly transpired that night?

Round 6:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:  
In B's last utterance A get explicature that during B's pause at the florist's window, they were focused on the display and only noticed a couple of passersby without anything else standing out.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:  
From the explicature that during B's pause at the florist's window, they were focused on the display and only noticed a couple of passersby, combined with A's believed fact that disturbances were reported at this time and location, A can infer implicature that B might have overlooked critical events occurring behind them during their distraction.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:  
A get explicature that during B's pause at the florist's window, they were focused on the display and only noticed a couple of passersby, and implicature that B might have overlooked critical events during their distraction. A can conclude the fact that B had a window of distraction when something significant could have happened behind them.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:  
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation's integrity or revealing its current status. The received fact that B had a window of distraction when something significant could have happened behind them makes a contribution by highlighting a potential gap in B's attention that aligns with the timing of reported disturbances.

5. Refine new goal depending on the contribution:  
Because of the contribution that there was a potential gap in B's attention that aligns with the timing of reported disturbances, A can refine a new goal to explore this gap further to uncover any overlooked but relevant events that occurred when B was distracted.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:  
A's goal is to explore the gap further to uncover any overlooked but relevant events that occurred when B was distracted. To achieve the goal, A has informative intention to gather more specific details about who might have been around or events that could have occurred unobserved and communicative intention to prompt B to reflect on subtle activities or interactions that might not have been registered due to the distraction.

7. Utter depending on the A's informative intention and communicative intention:  
A's informative intention is to gather more specific details about who might have been around or events that could have occurred unobserved, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is to prompt B to reflect on subtle activities or interactions that might not have been registered due to the distraction, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:  
A: It's quite common for us to miss what's happening around us when something captivating catches our eye. Considering that possibility at the florist's, do you recall if there were any interactions or fleeting exchanges nearby that might have slipped through during that brief moment? Details that seemed mundane at first glance might hold more weight than they initially appeared.

all scripts of B: 
B: Detective, while I was momentarily engrossed in the florist's displays, nothing specific comes to mind in terms of interactions or exchanges. It's quite possible that nearby conversations or interactions were simply part of the ambiance, blending into the backdrop of my walk. The whole scene was just as expected—a few people milling about and the usual hum of the street. It's intriguing how context could suddenly shift the significance of such benign moments, don’t you think? I trust your investigation will uncover whether there's more to these ordinary happenings than meets the eye. How extensively are you exploring these everyday occurrences in your line of inquiry?

Round 7:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:
In B’s last utterance, A gets explicature that B was momentarily distracted by the florist's displays and doesn't recall any specific interactions or exchanges during that pause.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:
From the explicature that B was momentarily distracted by the florist's displays and doesn't recall any specific interactions or exchanges during that pause, combined with A's believed fact that disturbances were reported in the area, A can infer implicature that B might have inadvertently overlooked pertinent activity in the vicinity at that time.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:
A got explicature that B was momentarily distracted by the florist's displays and doesn't recall any specific interactions or exchanges during that pause, and implicature that B might have inadvertently overlooked pertinent activity in the vicinity at that time. A can conclude the fact that B's attention was diverted during a key moment on the evening in question.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation's integrity or revealing its current status. The received fact that B's attention was diverted during a key moment on the evening in question contributes to the goal by highlighting a moment where details may have been missed, allowing A to focus on that timeframe in the inquiry.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:
Because of the contribution that details may have been missed during B's distraction, A can refine the new goal to uncover any unnoticed interactions or activities during the timeframe when B's attention was diverted.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:
A's goal is to uncover any unnoticed interactions or activities during the timeframe when B's attention was diverted. To achieve the goal, A has informative intention to gather details about the timeframe when B's attention was diverted and communicative intention to encourage B to reflect deeper on what might have occurred during that pause.

7. Utter depend on A's informative intention and communicative intention:
A's informative intention is to gather details about the timeframe when B's attention was diverted, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is to encourage B to reflect deeper on what might have occurred during that pause, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like this:
A: It's intriguing that certain moments can blend into the background when our focus shifts elsewhere. During your pause at the florist, do you think anything might have happened nearby that, upon reflection, could fit within the disturbances reported? It might be helpful to consider context beyond the immediate surroundings to expand on any seemingly benign details.

all scripts of B: 
B: Detective, reflecting further on that brief pause, I can't confidently say anything happened that would match the disturbances reported. My attention was primarily captured by the florist’s vibrant displays, and any surrounding activity was largely peripheral to that moment. Considering the context beyond the immediate vicinity is intriguing, as it might suggest thread connections to broader events that went unnoticed. Perhaps the reported disturbances were concealed in the subtle interactions of everyday life, as they often are. It certainly seems like a challenging undertaking to weave these seemingly mundane occurrences into a coherent narrative of that night. How do you manage to unravel the hidden complexities within such ordinary settings?

Round 8:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:

In B’s last utterance A gets explicature that B's attention was primarily on the florist’s displays, and any surrounding activity was peripheral, with no specific disturbances fitting the reports from their perspective.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:

From the explicature that B's attention was primarily on the florist’s displays, combined with A's believed fact that the disturbances were reported to have occurred nearby, A can infer implicature that B may have unconsciously overlooked or dismissed potentially relevant activities due to their focus on personal distractions.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:

A gets explicature that B’s attention was on the florist's displays during the pause, and implicature that B might have overlooked relevant activities due to that focus. A can conclude the fact that B has no conscious recollection of disturbances but could have unnoticed relevant events during the pause.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:

A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation's integrity or revealing its current status. The received fact that B might have overlooked events during the pause contributes to the goal by identifying a potential gap in B's recall that could align with inconsistencies or unnoticed disturbances during their walk.

5. Refine new goal depending on the contribution:

Because of the contribution that B might have overlooked events during the pause, A can refine the new goal that is to subtly probe B for indirect cues or subconscious memories that could inform or corroborate unexplained disturbances.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention dependent on the refined goal:

A's goal is to subtly probe B for indirect cues or subconscious memories that could inform or corroborate unexplained disturbances. To achieve the goal, A has the informative intention to explore seemingly mundane details around B's pause, and the communicative intention to stimulate B's memory through indirect questioning and familiar context.

7. Utter depending on A's informative intention and communicative intention:

A's informative intention is to explore seemingly mundane details around B's pause, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is to stimulate B's memory through indirect questioning and familiar context, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:

A: It's fascinating how what seems routine can hold unexpected significance. During that familiar pause at the florist's, do you think a particular scent, sound, or even a glance could have briefly struck you as unique, only for it to slip away unremembered? Sometimes, our minds capture more than we consciously register, weaving subtle threads around us.

all scripts of B: 
B: Detective, during that moment by the florist's, it's possible that a unique fragrance or a fleeting sound might have momentarily registered, yet it slipped away into the recesses of my mind. The florist's arrangements often bring a fusion of scents that can be quite distinctive, mingling subtly in the air. Perhaps there were fragments of a conversation or the sound of a closing door that intricately melded into the backdrop, unnoticed yet potentially significant. It's intriguing to consider how our senses capture and occasionally veil these threads of experience. Unraveling such subtleties must be an intricate part of your investigative tapestry. Are minor sensory cues generally significant in revealing concealed connections within your inquiries?

Round 9:
all scripts of A: 
1. Get explicature from B’s last utterance:
In B’s last utterance, A gets explicature that B experienced potentially unique fragrances or fleeting sounds by the florist's but these details might have slipped away from conscious memory.

2. Infer implicature from explicature combined with believed fact:
From the explicature that B experienced potentially unique fragrances or sounds without conscious recognition, combined with A's believed fact that sensory details can provide crucial context, A can infer implicature that there might have been subtle but important occurrences in that environment that B is unaware of.

3. Conclude fact received from this round:
A gets explicature that B experienced potentially unique fragrances or sounds and implicature that there might have been subtle but important occurrences in that environment that B is unaware of. A can conclude the fact that there are sensory details at the florist's that could be relevant to the investigation.

4. Evaluate the contribution of the received fact to the goal:
A's goal is to uncover the truth behind the suspect's statements without compromising the investigation's integrity. The received fact that there are sensory details at the florist’s that could be relevant makes a contribution to the goal by highlighting an area that may reveal previously unnoticed but important evidence.

5. Refine new goal depend on the contribution:
Because of the contribution that sensory details at the florist's could be relevant, A can refine the new goal to further explore these sensory cues and their potential connection to the reported disturbances.

6. Make informative intention and communicative intention depend on the refined goal:
A's refined goal is to further explore sensory cues at the florist's and their potential connection. To achieve the goal, A has the informative intention to gather more detailed sensory impressions from B and the communicative intention to subtly prompt B to reflect more deeply on these overlooked cues.

7. Utter depend on the A's informative intention and communicative intention:
A's informative intention is to gather more detailed sensory impressions, which means information in A's utterance will mainly focus on that. A's communicative intention is to prompt B to reflect on these cues, which means A's utterance will imply B to pay attention to that. So A would utter like that:

A: You mentioned the distinctive blend of fragrances at the florist's. Can you try to recall if there was a particular scent or sound that, even for a brief moment, seemed out of place? Sometimes re-examining these subtle elements can bring hidden layers into focus, revealing their true value in understanding what happened that night.

all scripts of B: 
B: Detective, as I reflect on that moment, there might have been a fleeting scent that seemed somewhat unusual—a hint of something smoky blending subtly with the floral aromas, just for an instant before fading into the background. It's the kind of subtlety that's easily overlooked amidst the comforting floral bouquet. As for sounds, perhaps there was a faint hum, like a distant engine, more persistent than typical ambient noise. It's remarkable how such ephemeral elements can linger on the periphery of memory, potentially holding keys to understanding the broader picture. How often do these elusive sensory impressions provide clarity in your investigations, and do they truly hold weight in unraveling the complexities of a case like this one?
