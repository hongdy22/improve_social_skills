B: Of course, A. I'll take a look around and see what we can do. *scans the bus, noticing someone getting up to disembark* There’s an empty seat just over there. *gestures towards the free seat* Why don't we guide him over?

Let me ask if they'd like our assistance. *approaches the mother* Hi there, would you like a little support or maybe some space where it’s safer for you and your child? We can ask around to see if anyone else is willing to swap seats so you can sit together more comfortably.
B: That's a great idea, A. *moves closer to the mother and child* I’ll see if there’s anyone nearby who can help out. *notices a passenger standing up to gather their belongings* Excuse me, would you mind if these two took your spot once you're done?
