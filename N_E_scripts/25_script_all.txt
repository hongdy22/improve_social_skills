Round 0:
all scripts A: 
A: Hey B, your birthday's coming up! I was thinking we could hang out, maybe try that new café you like or chill at the park. What do you think?

all scripts B: 
B: Oh, that sounds nice, A. I always appreciate just spending time with you. You know how much birthdays mean to me. I can't help but wonder what it would be like to have a little more of a celebration, maybe something with a bit of a surprise element or gathering. But honestly, just being with you already means a lot.

Round 1:
all scripts of A: 
A: Oh, I totally get it, B! Birthdays are special, and since you mentioned a surprise element, maybe I can throw in a little unexpected treat. How about we gather a few of our close friends and do something more lively, perhaps a surprise picnic at the park? It'll be a memorable day for sure, filled with good times and lots of laughter.

all scripts of B: 
B: That sounds really lovely, A. I appreciate you thinking of adding something special to the day. It's just that birthdays give me this feeling where I hope for some meaningful recognition, a touch of magic, you know? Maybe it'll be even better with a personal touch or a little heartfelt moment. I know whatever we do together will be wonderful; it's the thought behind it that truly counts.

Round 2:
all scripts of A: 
A: Absolutely, B. I hear you, and I definitely want your birthday to feel as special as you hope. How about we combine the picnic idea with a little something personal? Maybe we can have our friends share a favorite memory with you, or I could put together a small slide show of our fun times together? I want to make sure it's a day full of meaning and the kind of magic you're looking for.

all scripts of B: 
B: That sounds truly thoughtful, A. I love the idea of a slide show and sharing memories—it’s those moments that really make everything feel special and cherished.

Round 3:
all scripts of A: 
A: I'm glad you love the idea, B, and I genuinely want to make this day as unique and reflective of our friendship as possible. How about during the picnic, we set up a little time capsule activity, where everyone, including us, writes down what they appreciate about you and what makes our friendship special? We can put all these thoughts in a jar to look back at in future years. It'll add an extra touch to the day, capturing meaningful moments that will last a lifetime. I'm really looking forward to seeing the smile on your face and making new memories together.
