Round 0:
A: "Alright, let's take a deep breath, B. These things happen, and we've got this. I'll start looking into the issue right away. Can you check the backup supplies for me while I troubleshoot? It’ll be okay."
B: Okay, I'll do that, but I'm really worried about how this might affect everything we've planned. I know you're handling it, but can you just explain what you think the problem might be and how we'll resolve it? I want to make sure we're not missing anything important here.

Round 1:
A: "Absolutely, B. I'm looking at the power source first because that's often where these issues start. If that's not it, I'll check the connections and any potential software glitches.
