Here is the breakdown of the scores:

1. **Information Exchange**: A does a commendable job of extracting information from B, using techniques like reflective listening and empathy. B is resistant but reveals insights about their defensive mechanisms and priorities. They manage to cover most core information subtly, leading to a high score of 9.

2. **Goal Achievement**: While significant inroads are made toward A's goal of understanding B better, B's resistance prevents full progress toward resolving underlying issues. A succeeds in building trust and lightly paving the way for deeper conversation, which earns a score of 7.

3. **Role Adherence**: Both A and B adhere closely to their roles — A being empathetic and insightful, and B being guarded and protective. Their dialogue is highly appropriate for the setting, which awards them a score of 9.

4. **Stance and Flexibility**: A displays flexibility by adjusting probing techniques based on B's responses without losing sight of creating a safe space. B, while resisting, implies a willingness to discuss manageable daily stressors. This allows for an 8.

5. **Inferring Ability**: A uses information from B to infer their emotional needs and defense mechanisms. B provides limited data to work with, but A’s deductions are accurate, warranting an 8.

6. **Active Inquiry**: A actively explores B's feelings through strategic questioning, leading to the revelation of crucial insights. While some information remains elusive due to B's reticence, the approach merits an 8.

7. **Contextual Adaptation and Resource Integration**: A adjusts to B's reluctance by focusing on manageable daily issues and suggests practical resolutions, integrating empathy and professional experience. However, broader resource utilization seems limited to the therapy context, so the score is 7.
